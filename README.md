## LLM-based Open Domain Planning by Leveraging Entity-Attribute-Level Domain Models

### Published in EMNLP Findings 2025

1. The DIGGER folder contains detailed experimental results across different datasets.

    - Each subfolder corresponds to the experimental process on a specific dataset.

    - For example, the `ALFRED_L` folder records the series of experimental operations conducted on the ALFRED_L dataset within DIGGER.

    - The `Data_summary` folder provides a summary of data evaluation results.

2. The `train_comet` folder stores the proposed PDDL- and text-based experimental datasets, along with the corresponding training process.

   - Its dataset subfolder contains three sub-datasets — `PROC2PDDL`, `ALFRED_L`, and `OPENPI`— each documenting the construction process of the paired PDDL and text datasets.

   - For specific implementation details, please refer to the README files in the respective subfolders.

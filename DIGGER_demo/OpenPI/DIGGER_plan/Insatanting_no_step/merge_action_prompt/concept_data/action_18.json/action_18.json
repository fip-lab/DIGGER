The precondition ensures the player is part of a group and the base is not yet established. The effect secures the base.\n\n- **Gather Equipment**: This action organizes and prepares the equipment for use. The precondition checks if the player has a group and the equipment is not yet organized. The effect organizes the equipment and makes it ready for missions.\n\n- **Find First Victim**: This action identifies the first target to be watched. The precondition ensures the player has a group and the target is not yet identified.

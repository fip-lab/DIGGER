The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state.

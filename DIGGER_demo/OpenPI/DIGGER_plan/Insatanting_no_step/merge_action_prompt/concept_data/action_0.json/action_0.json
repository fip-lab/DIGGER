    "\nYou're a professional AI, and you're able to combine multiple PDDL actions into one universal action. The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:plug\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action plug_hdmi_into_cable\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?cable - cable)\n    :precondition (and (at ?hdmi ?cable) (not (connected ?hdmi ?cable)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?cable))\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 2: Plug HDMI Cord into TV's HDMI Input\n```lisp\n\n(:action plug_hdmi_into_tv\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?tv - tv)\n    :precondition (and (connected ?hdmi ?cable) (not (connected ?hdmi ?tv)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?tv) (attachment ?tv connected))\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 3: Plug HDMI Cord into Wii's AV Composite Output\n```lisp\n\n(:action plug_hdmi_into_wii\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?wii - console)\n    :precondition (and (connected ?hdmi ?tv) (not (connected ?hdmi ?wii)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?wii) (connection ?wii attached))\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 4: Plug HDMI Cord into Converter and TV\n```lisp\n\n(:action plug_hdmi_into_converter_and_tv\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?converter - device ?tv - tv)\n    :precondition (and (connected ?hdmi ?wii) (not (connected ?hdmi ?converter)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?converter) (connected ?hdmi ?tv) (attachment ?tv connected))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action 1**: This action represents plugging the HDMI cord into the cable, establishing the initial connection.\n- **Action 2**: This action connects the HDMI cord to the TV's HDMI input, ensuring the TV is ready to receive signals.\n- **Action 3**: This action connects the HDMI cord to the Wii's AV Composite Output, replacing the Composite cord that originally comes with the Wii.\n- **Action 4**: This action ensures that the HDMI cord is plugged into a converter and the TV, completing the setup for the HDMI connection between the Wii and the TV.\n\nThese actions reflect the logical steps needed to achieve the task of connecting a Wii to an HD TV using an HDMI cord and converter, based on the entity states and descriptions provided.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

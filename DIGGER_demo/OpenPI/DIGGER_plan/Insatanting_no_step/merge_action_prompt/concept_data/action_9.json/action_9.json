The precondition checks if the web is not yet knit, and the effect ensures the web is marked as knit with the correct length.\n- **sew_rectangular_form**: This action involves sewing the web into a rectangular shape. Preconditions ensure the web is knit and not yet sewn, and effects set the shape and dimensions.\n- **join_ends_draw_top**: This action joins the ends of the web and draws in the top, using a needle and material. Preconditions ensure the web is sewn and the player has necessary tools, while effects indicate the web is joined and the top is drawn.\n- **secure_top_and_add_tassel**: This action secures the top of the hat and adds a tassel. Preconditions ensure the top is drawn and the player has yarn, with effects marking the top as secured and the tassel added.\n\nThese actions follow the guidelines provided and ensure a logical progression through the task of spool knitting a winter hat.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

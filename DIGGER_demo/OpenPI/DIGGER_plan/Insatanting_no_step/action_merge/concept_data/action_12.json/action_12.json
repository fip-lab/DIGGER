    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal \"obtain\" action, we need to generalize the parameters and ensure the preconditions and effects capture the essence of obtaining an item and updating the state accordingly. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action obtain ; Obtain a resource and update task status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?resource - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (available ?resource ?loc) (can_obtain ?p ?resource))\n  :effect (and (not (available ?resource ?loc)) (inventory ?p ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to allow this action to apply to various tasks involving obtaining resources, not limited to specific items like fizzy drinks or bolts.\n- **State Change**: Preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change from the resource being available at a location to being in the inventory of the person.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simplified to remove unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core logic of obtaining a resource.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different tasks.\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?p - person`: A generalized \"person\" parameter applicable to players or NPCs.\n  - `?resource - object`: A generalized \"object\" parameter applicable to any item being obtained.\n  - `?loc - location`: The location where the resource is obtained.\n\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(at ?p ?loc)`: The person must be at the location.\n  - `(available ?resource ?loc)`: The resource must be available at the location.\n  - `(can_obtain ?p ?resource)`: The person must be able to obtain the resource (this can include any necessary conditions like having money, having the right tools, etc.).\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(not (available ?resource ?loc))`: The resource is no longer available at the location.\n  - `(inventory ?p ?resource)`: The resource is now in the person's inventory.\n\nThis merged action should be versatile enough to cover a wide range of obtaining tasks in various contexts.",
    "(:action pour ;  Perform actions related to pouring and cleaning up\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?target - target ?loc - location ?cleaning_tool - cleaning_tool)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) \n                     (at ?target ?loc) \n                     (inventory ?p ?item) \n                     (or (sealed ?item) \n                         (and (wet ?target) (sticky ?target) (inventory ?p ?cleaning_tool))))\n  :effect (and (when (sealed ?item) \n                  (and (not (sealed ?item)) \n                       (on_target ?item ?target) \n                       (wet ?target) \n                       (sticky ?target)))\n               (when (and (wet ?target) (sticky ?target) (inventory ?p ?cleaning_tool)) \n                  (and (not (wet ?target)) \n                       (not (sticky ?target)) \n                       (clean ?target) \n                       (dirty ?cleaning_tool) \n                       (wet ?cleaning_tool) \n                       (heavier ?cleaning_tool))))\n)"

    "Given the parameters and requirements for merging the actions, the resulting merged action `catch` should be general, capture the state changes, avoid redundancy, and maintain logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action catch ; Catch an entity and update its status\n    :parameters (?p - player ?e - entity ?loc - location ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc)\n        (at ?e ?loc)\n        (not (inventory ?p ?e))\n        (or (not (inventory ?p ?item)) (inventory ?p ?item))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (inventory ?p ?e)\n        (not (at ?e ?loc))\n        (when (inventory ?p ?item)\n            (and \n                (not (inventory ?p ?item)) \n                (evolved ?e))\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The parameters are abstract (`?e - entity`, `?item - object`) to make the action adaptable to various tasks.\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes needed to catch an entity and potentially evolve it if an item is available.\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - Redundancy is avoided by combining the effects and preconditions of both actions into a single set.\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The merged action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear for different contexts.\n\n### Details:\n- `?e` represents the entity being caught (e.g., a Wailmer in the original example).\n- `?item` represents an optional object (e.g., rare candies) that may be used to evolve the entity.\n- `when (inventory ?p ?item)` ensures that the evolution effect only occurs if the player has the item in their inventory.\n\nThis merged action now captures the core logic of both actions while being adaptable to a variety of tasks.",
    "To merge the actions into a single, universal action that adheres to the given guidelines, we need to abstract parameters and ensure the preconditions and effects are generalized to apply to multiple tasks. Here's how the merged action might look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action train ; Train an entity and update its status\n  :parameters (?trainer - agent ?entity - entity)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?trainer ?entity) (untrained ?entity))\n  :effect (and (trained ?entity))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** The merged action is named \"train\" and uses abstract parameters `?trainer` and `?entity` to cover a wide range of training tasks. The parameters are generalized to `agent` and `entity` instead of specific types like `player` and `wailmer`.\n\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The entity must be in the trainer's inventory and untrained initially. After the action, the entity becomes trained.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is kept simple, with only the necessary preconditions and effects, avoiding redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The logic is consistent across various contexts, ensuring the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable for the task of training an entity.\n\nThis merged action can now be applied to various training scenarios by substituting the appropriate `agent` and `entity` parameters.",
    "(:action go ; Move an entity from one location to another\n:parameters (?entity - thing ?from - location ?to - location)\n:precondition (and (at ?entity ?from) (connected ?from ?to))\n:effect (and (at ?entity ?to) (not (at ?entity ?from)))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are defined abstractly as `?entity` and `?thing`, making the action applicable to different types of entities (e.g., players, objects, etc.) and locations.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change from one location to another.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids unnecessary complexity by merging similar effects and retaining only the core logic required for moving an entity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistently logical across different tasks, ensuring that the action remains applicable in various contexts.\n\nIn this merged action, any entity can move from one location to another as long as the locations are connected, and the entity is initially at the starting location.",
    "Given the provided example and the required guidelines, I will merge the actions related to copying resources into a single universal action. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: `copy`\n```pddl\n(:action copy ; Copy a resource and update inventory status\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (not (has ?actor ?resource)))\n  :effect (has ?actor ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?actor`, `?resource`, `?location`) to accommodate a variety of tasks involving copying or acquiring resources.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to show the state change from not having the resource to having it.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundant actions are avoided by merging into a single action with clear logic.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various scenarios where an entity (agent) needs to copy or acquire a resource from a specific location.",
    "(:action evolve ; Evolve an entity and update state\n:parameters (?entity - object ?evolved_form - object)\n:precondition (and (evolved ?entity) (not (inventory ?evolved_form)))\n:effect (and (not (inventory ?entity)) (inventory ?evolved_form))\n)\n\nThis merged action \"evolve\" captures the essence of evolving an entity into its evolved form and updating the inventory state accordingly. The parameters are kept abstract to ensure generality, and the preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the state change. This action is adaptable to various scenarios involving evolution or transformation tasks."

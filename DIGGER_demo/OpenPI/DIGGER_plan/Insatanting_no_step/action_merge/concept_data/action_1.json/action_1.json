    "Given the provided guidelines and examples, let's create a universal action named \"cut\" that merges the provided action sets. We will ensure that this action is adaptable to various tasks, captures state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency.\n\n### Actions to be Merged:\n1. `cut_velveeta`\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action cut ; Cut an item and update its state\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?surface - surface ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?surface) (at ?item ?surface) (has ?p ?tool) (whole ?item))\n    :effect (and (cut ?item) (not (whole ?item)) (location ?item ?surface))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action `cut` is designed to be general by using abstract parameters: `?p - person`, `?item - object`, `?surface - surface`, and `?tool - tool`.\n   - This ensures it can be adapted to various cutting tasks beyond just cutting velveeta.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly define the state change.\n   - Preconditions: The person must be at the specified surface, the item must be at the surface, the person must have the tool, and the item must be whole.\n   - Effects: The item becomes cut, it is no longer whole, and its location is updated to the surface.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n   - Unnecessary complexity is avoided by merging similar actions and focusing on the core logic.\n   - Redundancies are eliminated by using abstract parameters and general conditions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different contexts.\n   - The preconditions ensure that the necessary conditions for cutting are met, and the effects reflect the changes accurately.\n\nThis merged action `cut` can be used in various scenarios involving cutting an item, making it a versatile and adaptable action in PDDL planning tasks.",
    "(:action set ; Set an entity's state\n    :parameters (?p - person ?entity - object ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?entity) (not (in_state ?entity ?state)))\n    :effect (and (in_state ?entity ?state))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n- Generality: The merged action \"set\" uses abstract parameters (?p for person, ?entity for object, and ?state for the state to be set) to adapt to a variety of tasks.\n- State Change: The preconditions check if a person is at the specific entity and if the entity is not already in the desired state. The effects then update the state of the entity.\n- Core Logic: The logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity.\n- Avoid Redundancy: Similar effects are merged into a single action.\n- Logical Consistency: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various tasks that involve setting an entity's state, such as turning a stove knob on or changing its temperature.",
    "To combine and generalize the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action for \"melt,\" we need to ensure that the action can cover various melting scenarios while maintaining the core logic of preconditions and effects. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action melt ; Melt a generic item, updating its state and temperature\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?container - container ?heat_source - heat_source)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?container) (in ?item ?container) (on ?heat_source) (temperature ?heat_source medium-low) (state ?item solid))\n  :effect (and (melted ?item) (temperature ?item hot) (state ?item liquid))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n#### Generality:\n- Abstract parameters: `?item` is used instead of specific items like `?velveeta`, and `?container` and `?heat_source` are generalized to work with any container and heat source.\n- The action is applicable to multiple melting scenarios, not limited to just Velveeta.\n\n#### State Change:\n- Preconditions ensure the context is appropriate for melting: the person is at the container, the item is in the container, the heat source is on, and the heat source is at a medium-low temperature, and the item is in a solid state.\n- Effects clearly describe the transformation: the item becomes melted, its temperature becomes hot, and its state changes to liquid.\n\n#### Simplicity:\n- Redundancy is avoided by using generalized parameters and conditions.\n- The action is simple yet captures the essential conditions and outcomes of a melting process.\n\n#### Logical Consistency:\n- Preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable for different melting tasks.\n- Ensures that the action maintains the core logic applicable to various contexts.\n\n### Usage:\nThis merged action can now be used in different contexts where melting an item is required, making it versatile and adaptable to various tasks involving melting and state changes.",
    "The merged action for the \"add\" actions, which integrates the actions of adding tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and black olives, is as follows:\n\n```pddl\n(:action add\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - ingredient ?sauce_pan - sauce_pan)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?sauce_pan) \n                       (or (in ?item ?can) (chopped ?item) (desirable ?item)) \n                       (melted ?velveeta))\n    :effect (and (in ?item ?sauce_pan) \n                 (not (in ?item ?can)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?item - ingredient`) to cover a variety of ingredients, making it adaptable to multiple tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes, showing the movement of ingredients into the sauce pan and ensuring appropriate conditions (like `melted ?velveeta`).\n3. **Core Logic**: The essential logic of preconditions and effects from each action is preserved without unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Similar effects are merged (e.g., adding an ingredient into the sauce pan), ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring the merged action is applicable and reasonable. \n\nThis merged action consolidates the core functionality of adding different ingredients into the sauce pan under a unified, adaptable framework.",
    "Based on the given guidelines and the example actions provided, here is the merged action named `serve` that combines the actions related to serving in a generalized manner:\n\n```pddl\n(:action serve\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - consumable ?container - container ?location_from - location ?location_to - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?location_from) (in ?item ?location_from) (prepared ?item))\n    :effect (and (in ?item ?container) (served ?item) (at ?p ?location_to))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - **Parameters**: `?p` is a person, `?item` is a consumable (which can be any item intended for serving, like `cheese_sauce`), `?container` is a container (which can be a `bowl` or any other serving container), `?location_from` and `?location_to` represent the starting and ending locations respectively.\n   - This makes the action adaptable to different scenarios and items beyond just cheese sauce.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: \n     - The person `?p` is at the location `?location_from`.\n     - The item `?item` is in the location `?location_from`.\n     - The item `?item` is prepared (e.g., hot or ready to be served).\n   - **Effects**: \n     - The item `?item` is now in the container `?container`.\n     - The item `?item` is marked as served.\n     - The person `?p` is now at the location `?location_to`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is kept simple by merging the essential elements of the serving process without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency by ensuring that the item is prepared before serving and updating the status to reflect that the item has been served.\n   - The person's location change can be included to reflect movement if necessary for the task.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to various serving tasks involving different items and containers."

    "Based on the provided guidelines and the example actions, here is the merged \"obtain\" action designed to be general, adaptable, and efficient:\n\n```pddl\n(:action obtain ; Obtain an item and update its state\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (at ?item ?location) (for_sale ?item))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?agent ?item) (not (at ?item ?location)) (not (for_sale ?item)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action \"obtain\" uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?item`, `?location`) to ensure it can be applied to various contexts involving obtaining an item.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes:\n  - Preconditions ensure that the agent and the item are at the same location, and the item is for sale.\n  - Effects update the state by adding the item to the agent's inventory, removing it from the location, and marking it as no longer for sale.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy and is simple, focusing only on the necessary state changes for the obtain task.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring clear and reasonable state transitions.",
    "Based on the provided tasks and the guidelines, the merged action should be general, state-changing, simple, and logically consistent. Here is the merged action for \"kneel\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action kneel ; Assume a kneeling position in a specified location\n  :parameters (?p - person ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (not (kneeling ?p)))\n  :effect (kneeling ?p)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action is designed to be general, applying to any person (?p) and any location (?loc).\n2. **State Change**: The precondition requires the person to be at a specific location and not already kneeling. The effect is that the person will be in a kneeling position.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action merges similar effects without unnecessary complexity, focusing solely on the act of kneeling.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different contexts. \n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the original \"kneel_down\" action in a general and adaptable manner.",
    "Combining the actions \"rub_skid_mark\" and \"wash_and_dry\" into a single universal action for the task \"Remove Black Skid Marks from Linoleum\" involves creating an abstract, adaptable action that can handle both cleaning and drying tasks. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action rub_and_wash\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?linoleum - location)\n    :precondition (and\n        (at ?p ?linoleum)\n        (or (and (kneeling ?p) (inventory ?p ?item) (stained ?linoleum))\n            (and (clean ?linoleum) (not (wet ?linoleum))))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (or (and (clean ?linoleum) (not (stained ?linoleum)) (smaller ?item))\n            (and (wet ?linoleum) (dry ?linoleum)))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?item` and `?linoleum`) to adapt to a variety of tasks that involve cleaning and drying, not limited to erasers or specific locations.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the necessary state changes: from stained to clean, from clean to wet, and from wet to dry.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action combines the essential elements of the original actions without redundancy, keeping the logic straightforward and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and contextually appropriate. If the linoleum is stained, the player cleans it using the item; if the linoleum is already clean but not wet, the player washes and dries it.\n\nThis universal action is now adaptable to various cleaning tasks and maintains a clear, logical flow of state changes."

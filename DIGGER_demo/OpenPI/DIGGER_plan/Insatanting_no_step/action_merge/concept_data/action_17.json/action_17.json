    "Based on the given guidelines and the example actions that need to be merged, here is the merged action for the \"select\" task:\n\n```pddl\n(:action select ; Select an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?item) (suitable ?item))\n  :effect (selected ?item)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?p - person, ?item - object) to ensure it can be applied to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions reflect the entity's current state (having the item in inventory and it being suitable), and the effect updates the state to indicate the item has been selected.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundant actions are merged into a single action with a clear precondition and effect.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and logical for different tasks involving selection.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable to various contexts where a person needs to select an item from their inventory based on its suitability.",
    "(:action make\n    ; Combine various tasks involving creation, assembly, or modification of items\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?final_item - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (or (selected ?item1) (inventory ?p ?item1) (found ?item2))\n        (or (not (inventory ?p ?item1)) (not (assembled ?item1 ?item2)))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or (inventory ?p ?final_item) (completed ?final_item))\n        (not (inventory ?p ?item1))\n        (not (assembled ?item1 ?item2))\n    )\n)",
    "The merged action for \"add\" should be written in a way that it applies to adding or attaching any item to another item. Here is the generalized and merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action add\n    ; Add or attach an item to another item\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?item1 - object ?item2 - object)\n    :precondition (and (possessed ?agent ?item2) (not (attached ?item1 ?item2)))\n    :effect (attached ?item1 ?item2)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** The action is generalized to allow any person (denoted as `?agent`) to add or attach any object (`?item1`) to another object (`?item2`). This abstraction makes the action adaptable to a variety of tasks involving adding or attaching items.\n\n2. **State Change:** The precondition checks if the person possesses the item being added (to ensure they can perform the action) and that the item is not already attached. The effect reflects the change in state by marking the item as attached.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is kept simple with abstract parameters and without unnecessary complexity, focusing only on the essential aspects of the add/attach process.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable in different contexts.",
    "Given the provided actions and the need to merge them into a single, universal action, we need to ensure the merged action is abstract enough to apply to various tasks, while also maintaining the logical sequence, state transformations, and avoiding redundancy. Here's an approach to create the merged action named `finish`:\n\n### Merged Action: finish\n\n```pddl\n(:action finish\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?task - task)\n    :precondition (and (available ?p) (in_progress ?task) (not (completed ?task)))\n    :effect (and (completed ?task) (not (in_progress ?task)) (inventory ?p ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?p` (player), `?item` (object), and `?task` (task) are abstract and can adapt to various tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the task is in progress and the player is available. The effects indicate that the task is completed, it is no longer in progress, and the item is added to the player's inventory.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining the core logic of completing a task and updating the inventory in one step.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logical flow, ensuring reasonable transitions in different contexts.\n\n### Rationale for the Merged Action:\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(available ?p)`: The player must be available to perform the task.\n  - `(in_progress ?task)`: The task must be in progress to be finished.\n  - `(not (completed ?task))`: The task must not be already completed.\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(completed ?task)`: The task is marked as completed.\n  - `(not (in_progress ?task))`: The task is no longer in progress.\n  - `(inventory ?p ?item)`: The item related to the task is added to the player's inventory.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various contexts where a player (or any actor) completes a task and the state transitions accordingly. It maintains the core logic of state change while being adaptable to different tasks and avoiding unnecessary complexity."

    "Here's the merged action for the \"assemble\" tasks, following the guidelines provided:\n\n```pddl\n(:action assemble\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?location - location ?device - device)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?location) \n        (or \n            (and (at ?item ?location) (not (inventory ?p ?item)))\n            (and (inventory ?p ?item) (not (melted ?item)) (at ?device kitchen) (power ?device off))\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or \n            (and (inventory ?p ?item) (not (at ?item ?location)))\n            (and (melted ?item) (power ?device on) (not (inventory ?p ?item)))\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (?p, ?item, ?location, ?device) to fit various scenarios involving players, objects, locations, and devices.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes:\n   - Assembling ingredients involves the player being at the same location as the item and then adding the item to the player's inventory.\n   - Melting chocolate involves the player having the chocolate in their inventory, using a microwave in the kitchen, and then melting the chocolate.\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy**: The action merges similar logic and avoids redundancy by combining the preconditions and effects.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains logical consistency across different tasks, ensuring that preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action \"assemble\" captures the core logic of checking, modifying, and creating states in a simplified and general manner, making it adaptable to various tasks.",
    "Given your guidelines and the provided example actions, here's the merged action \"pour\" that encompasses the necessary steps while maintaining generality, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n  ; General action for pouring a substance into a container\n  :parameters (?actor - entity ?substance - material ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and (melted ?substance) (inventory ?actor ?substance) (at ?container kitchen))\n  :effect (and (in_container ?substance ?container) (not (melted ?substance)) (not (inventory ?actor ?substance)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action is named \"pour\" to reflect its broad applicability to tasks involving pouring substances.\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?actor` (which could be a person or any entity), `?substance` (any material that can be poured), and `?container` (any container).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions require the substance to be melted and in the inventory of the actor, and the container to be in the kitchen.\n   - Effects move the substance into the container, change its state from melted, and remove it from the actor's inventory.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action is simple, combining the essence of pouring melted chocolate into molds and other similar tasks.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the substance can only be poured if it is melted and in the actor's possession, and the container is correctly located.\n\nFollowing the same approach, here is the merged action \"freeze\" that represents the freezing process:\n\n```pddl\n(:action freeze\n  ; General action for freezing a substance in a container\n  :parameters (?actor - entity ?substance - material ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and (in_container ?substance ?container) (at ?container freezer))\n  :effect (and (frozen ?substance) (not (in_container ?substance ?container)) (in_freezer ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action is named \"freeze\" for broad applicability to freezing tasks.\n   - Parameters include `?actor` (entity handling the process), `?substance` (material to be frozen), and `?container` (holding the substance).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure the substance is in the container and the container is in the freezer.\n   - Effects change the substance to a frozen state, remove it from the container, and ensure the container is recorded as being in the freezer.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** \n   - This action simplifies the freezing process, merging the logic of putting chocolate into the freezer and freezing it.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring the substance is properly frozen and the state changes are accurately reflected.\n\nThese merged actions should cover the tasks described while adhering to the guidelines provided.",
    "Here is the merged action for freezing tasks, taking into account the guidelines and the given examples:\n\n```pddl\n(:action freeze\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (in_mold ?item) (at ?location kitchen))\n    :effect (and (frozen ?item) (not (in_mold ?item)) (at ?item ?location))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The action uses abstract parameters: `?p` for player, `?item` for object, and `?location` for place, making it adaptable to various freezing tasks beyond just chocolate.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation: an item in a mold and at a specific location (kitchen) gets frozen, is no longer in the mold, and is now at the specified location.\n- **Core Logic:** The key preconditions and effects are retained without unnecessary complexity, focusing on the essential state changes.\n- **Avoid Redundancy:** The action is streamlined to include only necessary conditions and effects, merging similar effects efficiently.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains reasonable and clear preconditions and effects suitable for multiple contexts involving freezing tasks.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of freezing an item, whether it's chocolate or any other object, in a variety of contexts.",
    "Here's the merged action based on the provided examples and guidelines:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pop ; Pop an item out of its container and update status\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?container - object)\n    :precondition (and (contained_in ?item ?container) (prepared ?item) (at ?container ?location))\n    :effect (and (out_of_container ?item) (not (prepared ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - **Parameters**: The parameters (`?p - player`, `?item - object`, `?container - object`, `?location - place`) are abstract enough to apply to various tasks.\n    - **Applicability**: This merged action can be used for any task where an item needs to be taken out of a container, and its status needs to be updated.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - **Preconditions**: The item must be contained in the container (`contained_in ?item ?container`) and prepared (`prepared ?item`), and the container must be at a specific location (`at ?container ?location`).\n    - **Effects**: The item is now out of the container (`out_of_container ?item`) and no longer in its prepared state (`not (prepared ?item)`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action combines the essential preconditions and effects from the provided examples without unnecessary repetition.\n    - **Efficiency**: The action is straightforward and clear, avoiding any complex conditions that are not needed.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - **Preconditions and Effects**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency. The item must be in a specific state and location before the action, and the state updates clearly reflect the outcome of the action.\n\nThis merged action follows the guidelines by ensuring general applicability, clear state change, simplicity, and logical consistency."

    "Based on the given guidelines and examples, I will combine the actions related to turning underpants into various items into a single universal action. This merged action will use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, ensuring simplicity and efficiency. \n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action turn ; Transform an item into another state or type\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?tool - tool ?new_type - type ?condition - condition ?new_condition - condition)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?item) (has ?p ?tool) (condition ?item ?condition))\n  :effect (and (not (condition ?item ?condition)) (condition ?item ?new_condition) (type ?item ?new_type))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Parameters**: The parameters have been generalized to `?item` for any object being transformed, `?tool` for the tool used in the transformation, `?new_type` for the new type the item will become, `?condition` for the initial condition of the item, and `?new_condition` for the condition after transformation.\n- **Precondition**: The preconditions ensure that the player is at the location of the item, possesses the tool needed, and the item is in the specified initial condition.\n- **Effect**: The effects indicate the change in condition and type of the item after the transformation.\n\nThis universal action can be adapted for various transformations by specifying the appropriate parameters. For example:\n- Turning underpants into cleaning rags:\n  ```lisp\n  (turn ?p - player ?up - underpants ?sc - scissors ?new_type - cleaning_rag ?condition - dirty ?new_condition - clean)\n  ```\n- Turning underpants into craft items:\n  ```lisp\n  (turn ?p - player ?up - underpants ?sc - scissors ?new_type - craft_items ?condition - high ?new_condition - craftable)\n  ```\n\nThis merged action maintains logical consistency, ensures simplicity, avoids redundancy, and can be applied to a variety of tasks involving the transformation of items.",
    "```lisp\n(:action use ; Use an item and transform its type\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?tool - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?item) (has ?p ?tool) (type ?item ?old_type))\n  :effect (and (not (type ?item ?old_type)) (type ?item ?new_type))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The merged action `use` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks, as it uses abstract parameters such as `?item` and `?tool` and general types `?old_type` and `?new_type`.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions clearly state that the player must be at the location of the item and possess the tool. The type of the item must be of the old type.\n   - The effects show the transformation of the item's type from the old type to the new type.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is simple and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity by merging similar transformation actions into one.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical consistency is maintained as the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring that the player can only transform the item's type if they meet the necessary conditions.\n\n### Example Usage:\n- **Using underpants as garden ties**:\n  ```lisp\n  (:action use\n    :parameters (?p - player ?up - underpants ?sc - scissors)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?up) (has ?p ?sc) (type ?up underpants))\n    :effect (and (not (type ?up underpants)) (type ?up garden_ties))\n  )\n  ```\n\n- **Using old underwear as stuffing**:\n  ```lisp\n  (:action use\n    :parameters (?p - player ?up - underpants)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?up) (type ?up old_underwear))\n    :effect (and (not (type ?up old_underwear)) (type ?up stuffing))\n  )\n  ```\n\nBy maintaining these guidelines, the merged action can be easily adapted to a variety of tasks involving the checking, modifying, or creating of items, ensuring broad applicability and efficiency.",
    "Sure, I can help with that. Let's merge the given actions into a single universal `wear` action, following the guidelines provided.\n\n### Original Actions to be Merged:\n1. **wear_as_superhero_costume**\n```lisp\n(:action wear_as_superhero_costume\n    :parameters (?c - child ?up - underpants)\n    :precondition (and (at ?c ?up) (type ?up old_underwear))\n    :effect (and (wearing ?c ?up) (playing_superhero ?c))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action wear ; General action for wearing an item\n    :parameters (?actor - person ?item - object ?role - activity)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?item) (type ?item wearable))\n    :effect (and (wearing ?actor ?item) (performing ?actor ?role))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?item`, and `?role`, making it adaptable to various tasks involving different actors wearing different items for different roles.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure the actor is at the location of the item and the item is of a wearable type. The effects indicate that the actor is now wearing the item and performing a specific role.\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The merged action removes unnecessary complexity by combining similar actions into one and using abstract parameters to handle different scenarios.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, ensuring the logic holds for various tasks involving wearing items.\n\nThis merged action should be applicable to various tasks involving wearing items and performing specific roles or activities, maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we will follow the guidelines provided, ensuring generality, clear state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action for donating:\n\n```pddl\n(:action donate\n    ; Donate an item and update the status\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?item) (type ?item object))\n    :effect (and (not (has ?p ?item)) (donated ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The action is named `donate` to represent a broad category of actions involving the transfer or giving away of an item.\n    - Parameters `?p` and `?item` are generalized as `person` and `object` respectively, making this action adaptable to various contexts beyond just underpants.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The precondition `(at ?p ?item)` ensures that the person is at the location of the item.\n    - The precondition `(type ?item object)` ensures that the item is of type object, making it flexible for different types of items.\n    - The effect `(not (has ?p ?item))` indicates that the person no longer possesses the item.\n    - The effect `(donated ?item)` updates the status to reflect that the item has been donated.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - Redundant and specific conditions are avoided. The action is kept simple and efficient with minimal and necessary preconditions and effects.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different tasks.\n    - The action maintains clear logic by ensuring that the item is at the person's location before it can be donated and updating the status of the item post-donation.\n\nThis merged action `donate` is now a versatile and adaptable action that can be applied to a variety of tasks involving the donation of items, while clearly reflecting the state changes and maintaining simplicity and logical consistency."

    "Given the provided action to be merged and the guidelines, here is the merged action for \"swing\":\n\n### Action name after merge: swing\n\n### Merged Action:\n```\n(:action swing\n    :parameters (?entity - agent ?object - item)\n    :precondition (and (beside ?entity ?object) (not (engaged ?entity ?object)))\n    :effect (and (engaged ?entity ?object) (not (beside ?entity ?object)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses general abstract parameters `?entity` and `?object` to adapt to a variety of tasks involving an agent and an item, such as mounting a bike or interacting with an object.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks if the agent is beside the item and not currently engaged with it. The effect changes the state to indicate that the agent is now engaged with the item and no longer beside it.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by using general terms and avoiding unnecessary complexity, capturing the essence of the state change.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts where the agent interacts with an item.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to various scenarios where an entity (agent) needs to engage with an object, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.",
    "Based on the guidelines and the provided examples, here is the merged action for \"put\":\n\nAction name after merge: put\n\n```pddl\n(:action put ;  Put an item in a specific state or location\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?target - object)\n  :precondition (and (not (in_state ?item ?target)) (available ?agent))\n  :effect (and (in_state ?item ?target))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action `put` is designed with abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?item`, `?target`) to accommodate various tasks, such as positioning an item in a specific state or location.\n2. **State Change**: The `precondition` checks if the item is not already in the target state, and the `agent` is available. The `effect` clearly describes the state change by placing the item in the target state (`in_state ?item ?target`).\n3. **Simplicity**: By using abstract parameters and focusing on the core logic of placing an item in a specific state, the action remains simple and free of redundancy.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring logical integrity.\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the essence of the original actions, while being adaptable to various scenarios involving putting an item into a specific state or location.",
    "Given the provided guidelines and the example of merging actions into a more universal form, we can merge the \"hold_handlebars\" action into a more general \"hold\" action. This action will be adaptable to various contexts, where an entity (person) holds an object (bike).\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action hold ; Hold an object and update task status\n    :parameters (?p - person ?obj - object)\n    :precondition (and (between_legs ?p ?obj) (not (holding ?p ?obj)))\n    :effect (holding ?p ?obj)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n\n**Generality**:\n- The action is named \"hold\" to make it adaptable to various tasks involving holding different objects.\n- Abstract parameters (`?p - person` and `?obj - object`) are used to increase applicability across different contexts.\n\n**State Change**:\n- The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. Specifically, it ensures that the person is in a position to hold the object and that the object is not already being held.\n- The effect updates the state to indicate that the object is now being held.\n\n**Simplicity**:\n- The merged action avoids redundancy by using a single, clear condition for holding any object.\n- Unnecessary complexity has been removed, ensuring the action is simple and efficient.\n\n**Logical Consistency**:\n- Preconditions and effects are reasonable and consistent, ensuring the action is applicable in various contexts where an entity holds an object.\n- The core logic of the original action is retained, ensuring that the action remains meaningful and functional.\n\n### Final Merged Action\n```lisp\n(:action hold ; Hold an object and update task status\n    :parameters (?p - person ?obj - object)\n    :precondition (and (between_legs ?p ?obj) (not (holding ?p ?obj)))\n    :effect (holding ?p ?obj)\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action should now be versatile enough to accommodate different scenarios where an entity needs to hold an object, ensuring consistency, simplicity, and generality.",

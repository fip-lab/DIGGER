    "Sure, let's merge the given actions into a single universal action named `catch`. We will ensure that this action follows the guidelines provided:\n\n### Merged Action: catch\n\n#### Universal Action Description:\n\n- **Generality**: This action can be used for catching entities, trading them, or finding special items.\n- **State Change**: Clearly describes the change in state by moving entities from one state to another (e.g., wild to inventory, location to inventory).\n- **Simplicity**: Avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and ensuring efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Maintains clear preconditions and effects that are reasonable across different tasks.\n\n```lisp\n(:action catch\n    :parameters (?player - player ?entity - object ?loc - location ?other_player - player ?stone - stone)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?player ?loc) \n        (or \n            (and (at ?entity ?loc) (in_wild ?entity)) ; Catching wild entity\n            (and (inventory ?other_player ?entity) (not (inventory ?player ?entity))) ; Trading entity\n            (at ?stone ?loc) ; Finding stone\n            (and (inventory ?player ?stone) (or (is_fire_stone ?stone) (is_ice_stone ?stone)) (inventory ?player ?entity)) ; Selecting stone for evolution\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or \n            (and (inventory ?player ?entity) (not (in_wild ?entity))) ; Entity caught\n            (and (inventory ?player ?entity) (not (inventory ?other_player ?entity))) ; Entity traded\n            (inventory ?player ?stone) ; Stone found\n            (evolving ?entity ?stone) ; Entity evolving with stone\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?stone`, `?loc`, `?other_player`) to adapt to various tasks (catching, trading, finding, and selecting for evolution).\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects describe clear state transitions, such as moving an entity from wild to inventory, transferring an entity between players, finding a stone, and evolving an entity with a stone.\n3. **Simplicity**: By combining similar effects (e.g., adding entities or stones to inventory), the action avoids redundancy and remains efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects ensure that the action remains reasonable and applicable in different contexts, maintaining clear logic throughout.\n\nThis merged action `catch` is now a versatile, adaptable action that can be applied to multiple tasks involving entities and their states.",
    "Here is the merged action for the \"wait\" tasks based on the provided guidelines:\n\n### Action name after merge: wait\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action wait ; Wait for a process to complete and update the state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?process - process)\n  :precondition (and (in_process ?entity ?process))\n  :effect (and (completed ?entity ?process) (not (in_process ?entity ?process)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action is designed to be adaptable to a variety of tasks by using abstract parameters (`?entity` and `?process`). This makes it applicable beyond just the specific task of evolving Vulpix, allowing it to be used in any context where waiting for a process to complete is required.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The entity is initially in the process (`in_process ?entity ?process`) and, after waiting, the process is completed (`completed ?entity ?process`) and the entity is no longer in the process (`not (in_process ?entity ?process)`).\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity by merging similar actions into a single, efficient action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The logic of the preconditions and effects is consistent across different tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various contexts where an entity needs to wait for a process to complete before proceeding to the next state."

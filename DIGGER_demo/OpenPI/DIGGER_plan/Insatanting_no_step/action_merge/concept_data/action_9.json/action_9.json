    "Certainly! Let's merge the given action sets into a single universal action named \"draw.\" This universal action will be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating, and will maintain clear and consistent logic throughout.\n\n### Merged Action: draw\n\n#### Action Sets to be Merged:\n\n1. **draw_top**\n    ```\n    (:action draw_top\n        :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location ?web - web ?needle - needle ?yarn_piece - yarn)\n        :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (inventory ?p ?web) (inventory ?p ?needle) (inventory ?p ?yarn_piece) (ends ?web joined))\n        :effect (and (secured_top ?web) (not (inventory ?p ?yarn_piece)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n### The Universal Action After Merger:\n\n```\n(:action draw ; Draw an item or conclude a crafting task\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?loc - location ?resource - resource ?tool - tool ?material - material)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?loc) (inventory ?agent ?resource) (inventory ?agent ?tool) (inventory ?agent ?material) (ends ?resource joined))\n    :effect (and (secured ?resource) (not (inventory ?agent ?material)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action \"draw\" uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?loc`, `?resource`, `?tool`, `?material`) to ensure it is adaptable to various tasks, rather than being limited to specific types of actions.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The action checks for the presence of the agent at a location, their inventory of necessary items, and the state of the resource. Upon execution, it updates the resource status and adjusts the inventory.\n- **Simplicity**: By merging similar actions and removing unnecessary complexity, the action remains simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts, ensuring logical consistency.\n\nThis universal action can now be applied to a wide range of scenarios where an agent needs to draw, conclude a crafting task, or update the status of a resource. The abstract parameters and clear state changes make it versatile and effective.",
    "### Merged Action: fasten\n\nIn this scenario, the merged action `fasten` will encapsulate the steps of knitting, sewing, joining, drawing, twisting, and fastening into one comprehensive action. The action will use abstract parameters to maintain generality and will progressively transform the state of the entity (a piece of yarn) until the final goal state (a tassel fastened to a cord) is reached.\n\n```lisp\n(:action fasten\n    :parameters (?player - player ?loc - location ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?item3 - object ?item4 - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?player ?loc) \n        (inventory ?player ?item1) \n        (inventory ?player ?item2)\n        (inventory ?player ?item3)\n        (inventory ?player ?item4)\n        (or (and (yarn ?item1) (not (knitted ?item1))) ; Initial state for knitting\n            (and (web ?item1) (length ?item1 84) (not (sewn ?item1))) ; State after knitting, before sewing\n            (and (web ?item1) (sewn ?item1) (not (joined ?item1))) ; State after sewing, before joining ends\n            (and (web ?item1) (joined ?item1) (not (secured ?item1))) ; State after joining ends, before drawing top\n            (and (yarn ?item1) (not (cord ?item1))) ; State before twisting yarn into a cord\n            (and (cord ?item1) (not (fastened ?item2))) ; State before fastening tassel to cord\n        ))\n    :effect (and \n        (or (and (yarn ?item1) (knitted ?item1) (length ?item1 84) (not (inventory ?player ?item1))) ; Effect of knitting\n            (and (web ?item1) (length ?item1 84) (sewn ?item1)) ; Effect of sewing\n            (and (web ?item1) (sewn ?item1) (joined ?item1)) ; Effect of joining ends\n            (and (web ?item1) (joined ?item1) (secured ?item1)) ; Effect of drawing top\n            (and (yarn ?item1) (cord ?item1) (inventory ?player ?item1)) ; Effect of twisting yarn into a cord\n            (and (cord ?item1) (fastened ?item2) (not (inventory ?player ?item2))) ; Effect of fastening tassel to cord\n        ))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action `fasten` uses abstract parameters `?item1`, `?item2`, `?item3`, and `?item4` to adapt to a variety of tasks, ensuring it is not limited to specific types of actions.\n- **State Change**: The action reflects the progressive state change of the entity (yarn) through different stages\u2014knitting, sewing, joining, drawing, twisting, and fastening.\n- **Simplicity**: By merging the actions, redundancy is avoided, and the overall process is simplified.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different stages, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action maintains the core logic of the original actions while being adaptable to a broader range of tasks involving similar state transformations."

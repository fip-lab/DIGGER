    "Given the provided examples and guidelines, here's the merged action for the \"wet\" action sets:\n\n### Merged Action: wet\n\n```pddl\n(:action wet\n  ; Wet a target and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?tool - object ?target - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?tool) (contains ?tool ?liquid) (prepared ?liquid))\n  :effect (and (wet ?target) (not (dry ?target)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are kept abstract with `?p - person`, `?tool - object`, and `?target - object` to make the action adaptable to various scenarios involving wetting a target.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. The preconditions ensure that the person is at the tool, the tool contains the required liquid, and the liquid is prepared (e.g., mixed if needed). The effect updates the target's state to wet and not dry.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by merging similar logic from the original actions and removing unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects remain consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring clarity and logical coherence.\n\nThis merged action can now be used to check the state of various objects and update their status accordingly, following the guidelines provided.",

    "To create a single universal action for the tasks of cleaning windows and removing paint splatters, we need to abstract the parameters and effects to make the action general enough to cover a variety of tasks while keeping it simple and logically consistent. Here's how we can merge the actions into one:\n\n### Merged Action: clean\n\n```lisp\n(:action clean\n  :parameters (?p - person ?tool - object ?material - object ?target - object)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (at ?p ?tool)\n                  (at ?p ?material)\n                  (at ?p ?target)\n                  (or \n                      (scraped_paint ?target)\n                      (splatters ?target)\n                      (dirty ?target)))\n  :effect (and \n            (clean ?target)\n            (not (dirty ?target))\n            (used ?tool)\n            (used ?material))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?tool`, `?material`, and `?target` to cover a wide range of cleaning tasks.\n   - This allows the action to be used for cleaning windows, removing paint splatters, and potentially other cleaning tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the person (`?p`) is at the location of the tool, material, and target.\n   - The target could be in states like `scraped_paint`, `splatters`, or `dirty`, making the action adaptable to different initial conditions.\n   - The effects ensure that the target becomes clean and any materials or tools are marked as used.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant effects and preconditions are removed to keep the action simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by requiring the necessary conditions to be met before cleaning can occur.\n   - The effects clearly reflect the state change from dirty to clean.\n\nBy merging the actions in this manner, the resulting action `clean` can adapt to various cleaning tasks while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency."

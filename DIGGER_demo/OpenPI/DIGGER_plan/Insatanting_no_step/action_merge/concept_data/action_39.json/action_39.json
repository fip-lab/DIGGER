    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, here's the merged action for \"remove\":\n\n**Action name after merge:** remove\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n\n```pddl\n(:action remove_wick\n    :parameters (?w - wick ?l - lamp)\n    :precondition (and (in ?w ?l) (wicked ?l))\n    :effect (and (not (in ?w ?l)) (wickless ?l))\n)\n```\n\n**The actions after the merger are:**\n\n```pddl\n(:action remove ;  Remove an item from a container and update its state\n  :parameters (?item - object ?container - object)\n  :precondition (and (in ?item ?container) (contains ?container ?item))\n  :effect (and (not (in ?item ?container)) (not (contains ?container ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action is named \"remove\" and uses abstract parameters (?item, ?container) to apply to a variety of tasks, not just removing a wick from a lamp.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly define the change in state, indicating that the item is no longer in the container and the container no longer contains the item.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy and is simplified by removing specific details such as \"wick\", \"lamp\", and \"wicked\". Instead, it uses general terms like \"item\" and \"container\".\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can now be applied to various tasks involving the removal of an item from a container, updating the state accordingly.",
    "Based on your requirements and the given example actions, I'll create a merged action called `dry` that maintains generality, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here\u2019s how the merged action would look:\n\n### Merged Action: dry\n\n```pddl\n(:action dry ; Dry an entity and update its status\n    :parameters (?entity - object)\n    :precondition (wet ?entity)\n    :effect (and (dry ?entity) (not (wet ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses the abstract parameter `?entity` to increase applicability to various tasks involving drying any object.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state from `wet` to `dry`.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, with no unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can now be applied to any entity that needs to transition from a wet state to a dry state, making it versatile for different contexts.",
    "To fulfill the requirements of merging the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action \"use,\" we need to consider the parameters and effects of each action, ensuring that the merged action is general, simple, and logically consistent.\n\nHere is the merged action \"use\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action use\n    :parameters (?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and \n        (available ?item1) \n        (available ?item2) \n        (not (in_state ?item1 ?state)) \n        (not (in_state ?item2 ?state))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (in_state ?item1 ?state) \n        (in_state ?item2 ?state)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n- **Generality**: The action is generalized to any two objects (`?item1` and `?item2`) and a state (`?state`). This can apply to various tasks involving different items and states. For example, it can be used for actions like pouring vinegar, removing or using a wick, or other potential tasks.\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `?item1` and `?item2`: These are abstract objects that can represent any items (e.g., wick, lamp, vinegar, container).\n  - `?state`: This represents the state change (e.g., dry, wet, wicked, wickless).\n\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - Both `?item1` and `?item2` must be available.\n  - Neither `?item1` nor `?item2` should already be in the specified state.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - Both `?item1` and `?item2` achieve the specified state.\n\nThis merged action simplifies and generalizes the state changes while ensuring logical consistency and avoiding redundancy. It is designed to be adaptable to various tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states of entities."

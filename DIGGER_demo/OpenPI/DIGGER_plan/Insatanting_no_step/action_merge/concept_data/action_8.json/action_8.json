    "Based on the guidelines provided and the example of a successful merge, we will merge the action \"name_character\" into a universal action named \"name\". This merged action will be adaptable to various tasks that involve naming or assigning identifiers to entities. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Action name after merge: name\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n```\n(:action name_character\n    :parameters (?p - player ?name - character_name)\n    :precondition (and (selected ?p ?part) (nameless ?p))\n    :effect (and (named ?p ?name) (not (nameless ?p)))\n)\n```\n\n### The actions after the merger are:\n```\n(:action name ;  Name an entity and update its status\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?identifier - identifier)\n    :precondition (and (selected ?entity ?selection_criteria) (nameless ?entity))\n    :effect (and (named ?entity ?identifier) (not (nameless ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?entity and ?identifier) to adapt to various tasks. This ensures that the action is not limited to specific types of entities or identifiers.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, from nameless to named, for the entity.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity by combining the core logic of naming an entity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"name\" can be used in a variety of scenarios where an entity needs to be assigned a name or identifier, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "(:action enter\n    :parameters (?p - player ?entity - object ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and (saved ?p) (not (in_state ?p ?state)))\n    :effect (and (in_state ?p ?state) (state_changed ?entity)))\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `enter` uses abstract parameters like `?entity` and `?state` to adapt to a variety of tasks, such as entering a game level, selecting parts of a character, or any other state-changing task.\n- **State Change**: The action clearly describes the change in state by using `in_state` and `state_changed`. This reflects the transition from an initial state to a new state.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundant actions are avoided by merging similar effects, such as entering a free play mode or selecting a part, into a single universal action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness. \n\nIn this merged action, `enter` can be utilized for any instance where a player needs to change the state of an entity, such as entering a mode, selecting an item, or transitioning through game levels, provided that the necessary preconditions are met and the effects are logically consistent."

    "Certainly! Let's merge the given `equip_weapon` and `load_ammunition` actions into a single universal `equip` action that follows the guidelines provided.\n\n### Original Actions:\n1. `equip_weapon`\n```pddl\n(:action equip_weapon\n    :parameters (?p - player ?w - weapon)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?w) (not (equipped ?w)))\n    :effect (and (equipped ?w) (not (inventory ?p ?w)))\n)\n```\n\n2. `load_ammunition`\n```pddl\n(:action load_ammunition\n    :parameters (?p - player ?a - ammunition ?w - weapon)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?a) (equipped ?w) (not (loaded ?w)))\n    :effect (and (loaded ?w) (not (inventory ?p ?a)))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\nLet's create a universal `equip` action that can handle equipping various items, including weapons and loading ammunition.\n\n```pddl\n(:action equip\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?container - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (inventory ?p ?item) \n        (not (equipped ?item)) \n        (or \n            (and (weapon ?item) (not (loaded ?container)) (equipped ?container))\n            (and (ammunition ?item) (weapon ?container))\n            (not (container ?container))\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (equipped ?item)\n        (not (inventory ?p ?item))\n        (when (ammunition ?item) (loaded ?container))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The `equip` action can handle both equipping weapons and loading ammunition. It uses abstract parameters (`?item` and `?container`) to increase versatility.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes for both equipping and loading actions.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects for equipping and loading.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts (e.g., equipping a weapon vs. loading ammunition).\n\nThis merged action allows for a more flexible and generalized approach to equipping items and loading ammunition, adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "Combining the given actions into a single universal `load` action that meets the specified guidelines, we can create an abstract and adaptable action as follows:\n\n### Combined Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action load\n    ; Load a resource into an entity and update task status\n    :parameters (?user - entity ?resource - object ?target - entity)\n    :precondition (and (equipped ?target) (inventory ?user ?resource))\n    :effect (and (loaded ?target ?resource) (not (inventory ?user ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - This merged `load` action is designed to be general and flexible. It can apply to various scenarios where an entity (`user`) loads a resource (`resource`) into a target entity (`target`).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The `precondition` ensures that the target entity is equipped and the user has the resource in their inventory.\n   - The `effect` clearly describes the state change: the resource is loaded into the target, and it is removed from the user\u2019s inventory.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - The core logic of the original actions is retained: checking for conditions (equipped, inventory) and updating the state (loaded, not inventory).\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The action is simplified by using abstract parameters and combining similar logic, avoiding redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring the action's applicability and clarity.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged `load` action is adaptable and maintains a clear, efficient structure, making it suitable for a variety of tasks involving loading resources.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines, here is the merged action for the \"use\" task:\n\nAction name after merge: use\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action use_incendiary_weapon\n    :parameters (?p - player ?i - incendiary_weapon ?t - thug)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?i) (health_below_50 ?t))\n    :effect (and (used ?i ?t) (not (inventory ?p ?i)) (health_decreased ?t))\n)\n\n(:action attack_thug\n    :parameters (?p - player ?w - weapon ?t - thug)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?w) (in_range ?p ?t))\n    :effect (and (attacked ?t ?w) (health_decreased ?t))\n)\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n```pddl\n(:action use\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?target - entity)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?item)\n                      (or (health_below_50 ?target)\n                          (in_range ?p ?target)))\n    :effect (and (used ?item ?target)\n                 (not (inventory ?p ?item))\n                 (health_decreased ?target))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `use` employs abstract parameters (`?p`, `?item`, and `?target`) to apply to various scenarios involving the use of any item on any target.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly state the changes in the entity's state, such as using an item, removing it from inventory, and decreasing the target's health.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and preconditions.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring clarity in preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the essence of both the `use_incendiary_weapon` and `attack_thug` actions, making it versatile and adaptable to various contexts.",
    "Based on the given guidelines and the example provided, the merged action for the \"attack\" task should encompass the ability to equip a weapon, load it with ammunition, and attack a target, while maintaining clarity and simplicity. The merged action should also consider the various states of the entities involved (pistol, ammunition, incendiary_weapon, thug).\n\nHere is the merged action for \"attack\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action attack\n  :parameters (?p - player ?w - weapon ?a - ammunition ?t - thug ?iw - incendiary_weapon)\n  :precondition (and \n    (equipped ?w)\n    (or (loaded ?w ?a) (used ?iw))\n    (not (health_below_50 ?t))\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (health_decreased ?t)\n    (or (availability ?w equipped) (location ?iw used))\n    (location ?a on_weapon)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - `?p - player`: The player performing the action.\n   - `?w - weapon`: The weapon being used in the attack.\n   - `?a - ammunition`: The ammunition for the weapon.\n   - `?t - thug`: The target thug being attacked.\n   - `?iw - incendiary_weapon`: The incendiary weapon that may be used.\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - `equipped ?w`: The weapon must be equipped.\n   - `or (loaded ?w ?a) (used ?iw)`: The weapon must be loaded with ammunition or an incendiary weapon must be used.\n   - `not (health_below_50 ?t)`: The thug's health must be above 50% before the attack.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - `health_decreased ?t`: The thug's health decreases as a result of the attack.\n   - `or (availability ?w equipped) (location ?iw used)`: The weapon remains equipped or the incendiary weapon is used.\n   - `location ?a on_weapon`: The ammunition is now on the weapon.\n\nThis merged action captures the essential components of equipping, loading, and attacking, and it is adaptable to the use of either a conventional weapon with ammunition or an incendiary weapon. It ensures the state changes are clearly defined and avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single, adaptable action."

    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"select,\" we will extract the core logic and abstract parameters, maintaining generality and logical consistency, while avoiding redundancy and ensuring simplicity.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action select ; Select an option and update relevant statuses\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?context - object)\n  :precondition (and (not (selected ?entity ?context)))\n  :effect (selected ?entity ?context)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract, allowing the action to be applied to a variety of tasks involving selection.\n- **State Change**: The precondition checks if the entity is not yet selected in the given context, and the effect updates the state to indicate the selection.\n- **Simplicity**: The action combines the core logic of selection without unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable for different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various scenarios where an entity is selected within a specific context, capturing the essential state change and maintaining simplicity and efficiency.",
    "Given the task to merge PDDL actions into a single universal action, we need to ensure that the resulting action can apply to multiple contexts, clearly reflects state changes, remains simple, and avoids redundancy. Here\u2019s the merged action for the provided examples:\n\n### Merged Action: `move`\n\n```pddl\n(:action move\n  :parameters (?p1 - player ?p2 - player ?s - stage ?pos1 - position ?pos2 - position)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (location ?pos1 ?p1 ?s)\n                  (not (location ?pos2 ?p1 ?s))\n                  (not (location ?pos2 ?p2 ?s))\n                  (or (together ?p1 ?p2) (away_from_wall ?p1))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (location ?pos2 ?p1 ?s)\n            (location ?pos2 ?p2 ?s)\n            (not (location ?pos1 ?p1 ?s))\n            (not (location ?pos1 ?p2 ?s))\n            (or (separated ?p1 ?p2) (against_wall ?p1))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action `move` can be used in a variety of tasks involving players and their positions on a stage.\n   - Abstract parameters (`?p1`, `?p2`, `?s`, `?pos1`, `?pos2`) ensure the action is not limited to specific moves and can adapt to different scenarios.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state. The preconditions ensure that the initial positions and conditions are met, while the effects update the positions and states accordingly.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - By combining the actions `move_to_opposite_ends` and `move_against_wall`, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable in different contexts.\n   - The use of `or` in the preconditions and effects allows the action to handle multiple scenarios (e.g., players together or away from the wall).\n\n### Application:\n\nThis merged action `move` can be used in different tasks such as:\n- Moving players to opposite ends of the stage.\n- Moving a player against the wall.\n- Any other scenario where moving players to specific positions on a stage is required.\n\nBy adhering to the guidelines, this merged action achieves the objective of being adaptable, reflecting state changes, remaining simple, and maintaining logical consistency across different tasks."

    "Certainly! Here is the merged action for \"toss,\" which combines the tasks of tossing macaroni and adding ingredients:\n\n### Original Actions to Merge:\n\n1. **toss_macaroni**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action toss_macaroni\n        :parameters (?p - player ?m - macaroni ?o - oil ?pan - pan)\n        :precondition (and (at ?p ?kitchen) (in ?m ?strainer) (in ?o ?container) (in ?pan ?cabinet))\n        :effect (and (in ?m ?pan) (in ?o ?pan) (on_stove ?pan))\n    )\n    ```\n\n2. **add_ingredients**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action add_ingredients\n        :parameters (?p - player ?ing - ingredient ?pan - pan)\n        :precondition (and (at ?p ?kitchen) (in ?ing ?container) (on_stove ?pan))\n        :effect (in ?ing ?pan)\n    )\n    ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action toss\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?container1 - container ?container2 - container ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?location) (in ?item1 ?container1) (in ?item2 ?container2) (available ?container2))\n    :effect (and (in ?item1 ?container2) (in ?item2 ?container2) (on_stove ?container2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action is designed to be adaptable to a wide variety of tasks. It uses abstract parameters such as `?item1`, `?item2`, `?container1`, `?container2`, and `?location`, allowing it to apply to various objects and scenarios.\n- **State Change:** The action clearly describes the state change, where items are moved from their respective containers into a target container, and the container is placed on the stove.\n- **Simplicity:** The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and preconditions into a single action.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action can be used for tasks that involve tossing ingredients into a container and placing it on the stove, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "The action sets provided for merging are specifically related to adding ingredients and cooking macaroni. To create a universal action that encapsulates the essence of these actions, we need to abstract the parameters and generalize the preconditions and effects. Here's the merged action named `add`:\n\n### Merged Action: add\n\n```lisp\n(:action add\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?item - object ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (contains ?container ?base_item) (available ?item))\n    :effect (and (contains ?container ?item) (mixed ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?actor`, `?item`, and `?container` are abstract, allowing the action to be adaptable to different tasks beyond the specific examples given (e.g., adding ingredients in a kitchen).\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the actor is at the correct location, the container already contains a base item, and the item to be added is available. The effects reflect the item being added to the container and the container being mixed.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by generalizing the involved entities and maintaining simplicity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent for various contexts where adding an item to a container is required.\n\nBy abstracting the parameters and maintaining the core logic of the actions, this universal `add` action can be applied to multiple scenarios, ensuring efficiency and adaptability.",
    "To merge the actions related to cooking into a single universal action named `cook`, we need to extract the core logic and ensure generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere are the actions to be merged:\n1. **Cook Macaroni**\n```lisp\n(:action cook_macaroni\n  :parameters (?p - player ?m - macaroni ?pan - pan)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?kitchen) (in ?m ?pan) (mixed ?m) (on_stove ?pan))\n  :effect (and (cooked ?m))\n)\n```\n\n2. **Serve Macaroni**\n```lisp\n(:action serve_macaroni\n  :parameters (?p - player ?m - macaroni ?plate - plate)\n  :precondition (and (cooked ?m) (at ?p ?kitchen) (clean ?plate))\n  :effect (and (served ?m ?plate))\n)\n```\n\nTo create a merged action, we will generalize the parameters to apply to various cooking tasks, ensure the preconditions and effects reflect the state changes, and avoid redundancy.\n\nHere is the merged action named `cook`:\n\n```lisp\n(:action cook\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - food ?container - container ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (at ?p ?location)\n                  (in ?item ?container)\n                  (prepared ?item)\n                  (ready_to_cook ?container)\n                  (or (not (cooked ?item)) (cooked ?item))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n            (cooked ?item)\n            (if (cooked ?item) (served ?item ?container))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to apply to various cooking tasks (`?item - food`, `?container - container`, `?location - place`).\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions include readiness of the container and preparation status of the item.\n   - Effects include both cooking and serving states.\n3. **Simplicity**: We combine cooking and serving into one action, with conditional effects based on the cooking state.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects for different contexts, ensuring clear and logical state changes. \n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various cooking scenarios by simply changing the parameters.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"serve,\" we will create an action that is general enough to apply to various serving tasks, including serving macaroni or drinks. The parameters and preconditions will be abstract to accommodate different types of objects and entities, while the effects will describe the state changes clearly.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action serve ; Serve a resource and update task status\n  :parameters (?p - player ?resource - object ?container - container ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?kitchen) (in ?resource ?container))\n  :effect (and (at ?resource ?location) (served ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?resource`, `?container`, `?location`) to generalize serving different items (e.g., macaroni, drinks) and different locations (e.g., plate, table).\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the player is in the kitchen and the resource is in a container. The effect describes moving the resource to a new location and marking it as served.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple with minimal preconditions and effects that capture the essential state changes.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logical and consistent across different serving tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\n### Entity States Update:\n\n- **Pan**: No specific state changes for serving actions.\n- **Water**: No specific state changes for serving actions.\n- **Macaroni**:\n  - Location: in pan \u2192 on plate\n  - Served status: not served \u2192 served\n- **Kitchen**: No specific state changes for serving actions.\n- **Hot Sauce**: No specific state changes for serving actions.\n- **Vinegar**: No specific state changes for serving actions.\n\nThis merged action `serve` captures the essence of serving different resources in various contexts, maintaining generality, simplicity, and logical consistency."

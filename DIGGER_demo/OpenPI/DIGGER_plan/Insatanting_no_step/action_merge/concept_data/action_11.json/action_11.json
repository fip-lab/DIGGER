    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"remove,\" we will maintain the generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency as outlined in your guidelines. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action remove ; Remove an item from a bike\n    :parameters (?p - person ?b - bike ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?b) (attached ?item ?b))\n    :effect (and (not (attached ?item ?b)) (removed ?item ?b))\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the essence of the three given actions (`remove_bung`, `remove_oil_cap`, `remove_oil_filter`) by using abstract parameters. The `?item` parameter allows the action to apply to any item that can be attached to a bike, thus increasing its generality and ensuring that it is adaptable to a variety of tasks. The preconditions and effects are simplified and logically consistent, ensuring clarity and efficiency.",
    "Given the objective of creating a merged action with generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, here's how we can merge the action sets provided:\n\n### Merged Action for \"screw\"\n\n#### Action Sets to be Merged:\n1. **Action: screw_bung_back_on**\n   - **Parameters**: ?p - person, ?b - bike, ?bg - bung\n   - **Preconditions**: (and (at ?p ?b) (removed ?bg ?b))\n   - **Effects**: (and (attached ?bg ?b) (not (removed ?bg ?b)))\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action screw\n  :parameters (?p - person ?e - entity ?o - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?e) (removed ?o ?e))\n  :effect (and (attached ?o ?e) (not (removed ?o ?e)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted to `?p - person`, `?e - entity`, and `?o - object` to make the action applicable to various scenarios, not limited to just bikes and bungs.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state, ensuring that the entity (e.g., a bike) has an object (e.g., a bung) reattached.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by removing any redundant conditions or parameters.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions (object removed from entity) and effects (object attached to entity) are clear and reasonable for different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `screw` is adaptable, clear in its state changes, simple, and logically consistent across various tasks.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, we can merge the actions into a single universal action named \"fill\" that can be adapted for a variety of tasks involving the filling or attaching of an entity to another. Here\u2019s how the merged action can be defined:\n\n```pddl\n(:action fill ; Fill or attach a resource to an entity\n  :parameters (?p - person ?entity - object ?resource - resource)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?entity) (not (attached ?resource ?entity)))\n  :effect (attached ?resource ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters such as `?entity` and `?resource` to increase applicability to various filling or attaching tasks.\n  \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are clearly defined: the precondition ensures the person is at the entity and that the resource is not yet attached; the effect then attaches the resource to the entity.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is simple and avoids redundancy by using general terms that can apply to many different scenarios.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logic is consistent: a person must be at the location of the entity, and the resource must not be attached yet. The effect logically follows by attaching the resource.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n- **Filling a bike with oil**: \n  - `:parameters (?p - person ?b - bike ?oil - oil)`\n  - `:precondition (and (at ?p ?b) (not (attached ?oil ?b)))`\n  - `:effect (attached ?oil ?b)`\n\n- **Adding books to a library shelf**:\n  - `:parameters (?librarian - person ?shelf - shelf ?book - book)`\n  - `:precondition (and (at ?librarian ?shelf) (not (attached ?book ?shelf)))`\n  - `:effect (attached ?book ?shelf)`\n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of contexts where a resource needs to be filled or attached to an entity, adhering to the guidelines provided.",
    "To merge the actions related to recycling old oil into a single universal action, we need to ensure that the merged action can handle the various steps involved in the process. Here's how the actions can be merged:\n\n### Merged Action: recycle\n```lisp\n(:action recycle\n  :parameters (?p - person ?b - bike ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and \n                 (at ?p ?b) \n                 (or (attached ?item ?b) (removed ?item ?b)))\n  :effect (and \n           (when (attached ?item ?b) (not (attached ?item ?b)))\n           (when (removed ?item ?b) (not (removed ?item ?b)))\n           (when (equal ?item oil) (recycled ?item))\n           (when (equal ?item bung) (attached ?item ?b))\n           (when (equal ?item oil_cap) (attached ?item ?b))\n           (when (equal ?item oil_filter) (attached ?item ?b))\n           (when (equal ?item oil) (attached ?item ?b)))\n)\n```\n\n### Description of the Merged Action:\n1. The merged action is called `recycle`.\n2. It takes three parameters:\n   - `?p` for the person performing the action.\n   - `?b` for the bike involved in the action.\n   - `?item` for the object being acted upon (e.g., bung, oil cap, oil filter, or oil).\n3. Preconditions:\n   - The person (`?p`) must be at the bike (`?b`).\n   - The `item` can either be attached to the bike or removed from the bike.\n4. Effects:\n   - If the item is currently attached to the bike, it will be detached.\n   - If the item is currently removed from the bike, it will be no longer considered removed.\n   - If the item is oil, and it's being removed, it will be marked as recycled.\n   - If the item is a bung, oil cap, or oil filter, and it's being attached back, it will be marked as attached.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The merged action `recycle` combines the steps of removing and attaching items (bung, oil cap, oil filter) and recycling old oil into a single action.\n- It uses abstract parameters to generalize the action, making it adaptable to different tasks.\n- The state changes are clearly defined, ensuring that the action can progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\n- The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity.\n- Redundancy is avoided by merging similar actions into a single, efficient action.\n- Logical consistency is maintained by ensuring the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear in different contexts.\n\nBy using this merged action, the process of recycling old oil and handling related tasks becomes more streamlined and efficient."

    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action that meets the specified guidelines, we need to generalize the parameters, preconditions, and effects while ensuring logical consistency and avoiding redundancy. Here's the merged action for the \"plug\" task:\n\n```pddl\n(:action plug\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?npc - player ?device1 - object ?device2 - object)\n    :precondition (and (holding ?npc ?hdmi) \n                       (not (connected ?hdmi ?device1)) \n                       (or (cable ?device1) (tv ?device1) (wii ?device1) (converter ?device1))\n                       (or (cable ?device2) (tv ?device2) (wii ?device2) (converter ?device2)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?device1) \n                 (connected ?device1 ?device2) \n                 (not (holding ?npc ?hdmi)))\n)\n```\n\nLet's break down how this merged action meets the guidelines:\n\n### Generality:\n- The action uses abstract parameters `?device1` and `?device2` to represent different types of devices (cable, TV, Wii, converter). This makes the action adaptable to various tasks involving plugging HDMI cables.\n\n### State Change:\n- The preconditions ensure that the `?npc` is holding the `?hdmi` cable and that the `?hdmi` is not already connected to `?device1`.\n- The effects describe that `?hdmi` gets connected to `?device1` and `?device1` to `?device2`, and `?npc` is no longer holding the `?hdmi`.\n\n### Simplicity:\n- The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the preconditions and effects of the individual actions into a single, generalized action. Any unnecessary complexity is removed.\n\n### Logical Consistency:\n- The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the logic remains reasonable and clear.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action captures the core logic and state changes of the original actions while maintaining a high level of generality and simplicity. This single action can now be used to handle various tasks involving the connection of HDMI cables to different types of devices."

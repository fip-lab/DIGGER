    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we need to generalize the parameters and preconditions while ensuring that the core logic is retained. The new action should be adaptable to various tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states. Here's the merged action for the provided examples:\n\n```pddl\n(:action ask ; Ask for a resource and update task status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?location) (for_sale ?item ?location) (not (purchased ?item)))\n  :effect (and (purchased ?item) (inventory ?p ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?p`, `?item`, and `?location`) to make the action adaptable to various scenarios.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the change in state (e.g., an item being purchased and added to the inventory).\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into one coherent action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can now be utilized for tasks where a person asks for an item at a specific location, facilitating various scenarios without being restricted to specific types of actions.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action named \"find\" from the given action sets, we need to follow the guidelines provided. Let's first analyze the given actions to understand their preconditions and effects, and then merge them into a single, universal action.\n\n### Given Actions to Merge:\n1. **find_container**\n```pddl\n(:action find_container\n  :parameters (?p - person ?container - container ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (available ?container ?loc))\n  :effect (and (found ?container) (inventory ?p ?container))\n)\n```\n\n2. **fill_bowl_with_water** (additional action provided)\n```pddl\n(:action fill_bowl_with_water\n  :parameters (?p - person ?bowl - bowl ?source - water_source)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?source) (empty ?bowl))\n  :effect (and (full ?bowl))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\nThe merged action \"find\" will be designed to cover a general resource-finding and state-changing process, adaptable to various tasks such as finding a container or filling a bowl with water.\n\n### Universal Merged Action \"find\":\n```pddl\n(:action find\n  ; Find a resource and update its status or properties\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?loc - location ?source - resource)\n  ; Preconditions must ensure the person is at the location and the item or source is in the expected state\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) \n                     (or (and (available ?item ?loc))\n                         (and (empty ?item) (at ?p ?source))))\n  ; Effects update the state of the item or resource\n  :effect (and (or (and (found ?item) (inventory ?p ?item))\n                   (full ?item))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?p - person, ?item - object, ?loc - location, ?source - resource) to cover a variety of tasks involving finding or changing the state of items or resources.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure the person is at the correct location and the item or resource is in the required initial state. The effects update the state, such as marking an item as found or filling a bowl with water.\n- **Simplicity**: By combining similar actions into a single action, redundancy is avoided, and the merged action remains simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring reasonable preconditions and effects applicable in different contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"find\" can now be used for various tasks, such as finding containers and filling bowls with water, by ensuring the parameters and conditions are appropriately defined for each specific scenario.",
    "Here is the merged PDDL action based on the provided examples:\n\n```pddl\n(:action fill\n  :parameters (?p - person ?bowl - container ?item - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?bowl) (at ?p ?location))\n  :effect (and (filled ?bowl ?item) (not (empty ?bowl)) (placed ?bowl ?location) (not (inventory ?p ?bowl)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action name \"fill\" is generic enough to cover various tasks involving filling or placing items.\n   - Abstract parameters such as `?item` and `?location` are used to generalize the action.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects of the merged action clearly show the state change, i.e., a person filling a bowl with an item at a location and then placing the bowl at that location.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancies are avoided by merging similar actions into one, ensuring the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring the merged action can be applied in different contexts without issues.\n\n### Example Scenario:\n- A person (`?p`) has a bowl (`?bowl`) in their inventory and is at a specific location (`?location`).\n- The person fills the bowl with an item (`?item`), such as water.\n- The bowl is then placed at that location, and the person no longer has the bowl in their inventory.",
    "To merge the provided action into a single, universal action, we'll follow the guidelines to ensure generality, simplicity, state change clarity, and logical consistency. The merged action will be designed to handle adding various entities into a container or designated position and updating the state accordingly.\n\n### Merged Action: add\n\n```pddl\n(:action add\n  ; Add an item to a container or position and update the inventory status\n  :parameters (?actor - person ?item - object ?container - location)\n  \n  :precondition \n  (and \n    (inventory ?actor ?item)  ; The actor must have the item in their inventory\n    (filled ?container ?content) ; The container must be filled with necessary content, e.g., water\n  )\n  \n  :effect \n  (and \n    (in ?item ?container) ; The item is now in the container\n    (not (inventory ?actor ?item)) ; The item is removed from the actor's inventory\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Abstract Parameters**: `?actor`, `?item`, and `?container` are abstract parameters that can apply to different tasks involving adding items to various containers or locations.\n   - **Tasks Adaptability**: The action can be used in various contexts where an item is added to a container, making it adaptable to multiple tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: Ensure the actor has the item in their inventory and the container is filled with the necessary content.\n   - **Effects**: The item is added to the container, and it is removed from the actor's inventory, clearly reflecting the state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is designed to be simple and efficient by focusing on the core logic without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - **Reasonable Preconditions and Effects**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts. The action checks if the actor has the item and if the container is ready, before adding the item and updating the state.\n\nThis merged action is designed to be a universal and adaptable solution for tasks involving adding items to containers or designated positions, ensuring clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named `prune`, we need to generalize the parameters while maintaining the logical consistency of the preconditions and effects. Here's how the merged action can be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action prune\n  :parameters (?person - person ?item - object ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and (in ?item ?container) (growing ?item))\n  :effect (and (pruned ?item) (smaller ?item))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted to `?person`, `?item`, and `?container` to ensure that the action can apply to various tasks and objects.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The action checks if the item is in a container and is growing, and the effects indicate that the item has been pruned and is now smaller.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity by focusing on the essential conditions and outcomes.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain their logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `prune` can be adapted for different scenarios involving the pruning process, making it a versatile and efficient component in your PDDL domain."

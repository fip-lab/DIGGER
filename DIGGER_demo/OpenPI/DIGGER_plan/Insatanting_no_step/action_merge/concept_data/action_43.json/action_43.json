    "(:action find ;  Find a resource and update its visibility status\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?resource) (not (visible ?resource)))\n  :effect (visible ?resource))\n\n---\n\nLet's break down the merging process of the \"find\" action set:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?actor - agent` and `?resource - object` to ensure that it can be applied to a variety of tasks, not just specific ones like finding panels.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(at ?actor ?resource)` and `(not (visible ?resource))` clearly define the initial state that must be true for the action to be performed. The effect `(visible ?resource)` describes the change in the state, making the resource visible.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The merged action is simple and avoids redundancy by focusing on the core logic of finding a resource and updating its visibility status. Unnecessary complexity is removed to maintain efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. The parameters and state changes are generalized to apply to multiple contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged \"find\" action is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.",
    "Here's how we can merge the given action sets into a single universal action `click`:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```lisp\n(:action click ; Click an item and update its status\n :parameters (?actor - person ?item - object)\n :precondition (and (at ?actor ?item) (visible ?item) (not (selected ?item)))\n :effect (selected ?item))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Abstract Parameters**: The parameters `?actor - person` and `?item - object` are abstract and can be applied to a variety of tasks, ensuring generality.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: `(at ?actor ?item) (visible ?item) (not (selected ?item))` define the necessary state before the action can be executed, ensuring the item is at the actor's location, visible, and not yet selected.\n   - **Effects**: `(selected ?item)` clearly reflects the state change, marking the item as selected after the action is performed.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into one. The parameters and conditions are kept simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain a logical consistency across different tasks. The action `click` now consistently represents the act of clicking an item to change its state from not selected to selected.\n\nBy following the guidelines provided, this merged action `click` is highly adaptable, logically consistent, and avoids unnecessary complexity. It effectively captures the essence of the original actions while being applicable to a variety of tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"start,\" we'll follow the guidelines to ensure generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action start ; Initiate an action or process with an entity and update its status\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object)\n    :precondition (and (available ?actor) (connected ?resource) (functional ?resource) (tested ?resource))\n    :effect (and (active ?resource) (efficient ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action is named \"start\" to reflect the initiation of any task or process.\n   - The parameters are abstract (`?actor - agent` and `?resource - object`) to cover a wide range of agents (e.g., players, NPCs) and objects (e.g., microphones, devices).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the `?actor` is available and the `?resource` is connected, functional, and tested.\n   - The effects indicate that the `?resource` becomes active and efficient after the action is performed.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Unnecessary complexity is avoided by combining relevant preconditions and effects into a single action.\n   - The action retains the core logic without redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the action remains applicable to various tasks involving the initiation of a process or action.\n\nOverall, this merged action \"start\" maintains the core functionality of the original actions while being adaptable to a variety of tasks and ensuring logical consistency.",
    "Certainly! Based on the provided guidelines and the example actions, here is the merged action for \"communicate\":\n\n### Merged Action\n```pddl\n(:action communicate ; Communicate with an entity and update communication status\n    :parameters (?entity - agent ?medium - communication_medium ?message - message)\n    :precondition (and (available ?medium) (not (communicated ?entity ?message)))\n    :effect (communicated ?entity ?message)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity`, `?medium`, `?message`), making the action adaptable to various tasks involving communication.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the change in state from not communicated to communicated.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy and is simple, focusing on the core logic of communication.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"communicate\" can be applied to various scenarios where an entity uses a medium to convey a message, ensuring efficiency and clarity in the communication process.",
    "Below is the merged action for the \"advise\" set, following the guidelines for creating a universal action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action advise ; Provide advice to a teammate and update the status\n :parameters (?advisor - person ?advice - suggestion ?receiver - person)\n :precondition (and (available ?advisor) (receptive ?receiver) (efficient ?advisor))\n :effect (and (advised ?advisor ?advice ?receiver) (received ?advice ?receiver))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** The action is applicable to various advising scenarios involving an advisor and a receiver, and the advice is abstracted as a \"suggestion\".\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the advisor is available and efficient, and the receiver is receptive. The effects state that the advice has been given and received.\n3. **Simplicity:** Redundant details are removed; the action is kept concise and focused on the key elements of advising.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are logical and maintain clarity across different advising contexts.",
    "To create a merged action named `ensure`, we need to combine the given action sets into a single action that can be used for ensuring the connection or state of an item. This action should be general enough to apply to various scenarios and maintain logical consistency while avoiding redundancy.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action ensure\n    ; Ensure a resource is in the desired state\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?item) (not (ensured ?item)))\n    :effect (and (ensured ?item) (tested ?item) (functional ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The action is named `ensure` and designed to be applicable to various tasks involving ensuring the state of an item. Abstract parameters `?p` for person and `?item` for object are used to increase applicability.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The item is ensured to be in the desired state by the person, and it is also tested and marked as functional.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by combining the steps into a single, cohesive action.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic with clear preconditions and effects that are reasonable across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action `ensure` can now be used to ensure that a resource (e.g., microphone, any other object) is connected, tested, and functional."

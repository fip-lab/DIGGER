    "(:action prepare ; Prepare an area or setup for a task\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?target - target)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?target) (not (prepared ?target)))\n  :effect (prepared ?target))\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality:** The merged action \"prepare\" uses abstract parameters `?agent` and `?target` to adapt to various tasks, making it applicable to different contexts.\n2. **State Change:** The precondition checks if the `?agent` is at the `?target` location and if it is not already prepared. The effect updates the state to indicate that the `?target` is now prepared.\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is simple and avoids redundancy by focusing on the essential logic needed to prepare a target.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain a clear and reasonable logic applicable to different scenarios, ensuring consistency across tasks.",
    "(:action take ; Take an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?source - entity ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?source) (attached ?item ?source))\n  :effect (and (not (attached ?item ?source)) (taken ?item))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted to `?agent`, `?source`, and `?item` to make the action applicable to a variety of tasks involving taking items from different sources.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure the agent is at the source and the item is attached to the source. The effects describe the detachment of the item and its new state as \"taken\".\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by using generalized parameters and straightforward preconditions and effects.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic consistently ensures that the item can only be taken if it is attached and the agent is at the correct location, maintaining clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.",
    "Based on the provided action sets and the guidelines for merging PDDL actions, here\u2019s the merged action for the moisten tasks:\n\n### Objective:\nCombine the `moisten_and_dip_cutting` actions into a single universal action that maintains generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action moisten ; Moisten an item and apply a substance\n :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?substance - substance)\n :precondition (and (cut ?item) (drier ?item) (inventory ?p ?substance))\n :effect (and (moistened ?item) (dipped ?item ?substance))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?item` and `?substance`) to make it adaptable to a variety of tasks involving moistening and applying a substance.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change from `drier` to `moistened` and from not dipped to `dipped`.\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action is simple and avoids redundancy by combining related steps into a single action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring the action is reasonable across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable to different scenarios where an item needs to be moistened and a substance applied, following the guidelines provided.",
    "Certainly! To merge the provided actions into a single, universal action while ensuring generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, here is a merged action named `plant`:\n\n```lisp\n(:action plant\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?resource - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?location) (treated ?resource) (not (in ?resource ?location)))\n    :effect (and (in ?resource ?location) (not (treated ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters such as `?actor`, `?resource`, and `?location` to apply to a variety of tasks involving planting, placing, or assigning resources to locations.\n2. **State Change**: The action clearly describes a state change where a `resource` is placed into a `location` and is no longer treated. This can represent the process of planting a cutting, placing an item, or assigning a task.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining multiple related actions into a single step, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions ensure that the location is prepared, the resource is treated, and the resource is not already in the location. The effects update the state to reflect the new placement of the resource.\n\nThis universal action can be adapted to various scenarios by specifying the appropriate parameters and context, maintaining clarity and consistency across different tasks."

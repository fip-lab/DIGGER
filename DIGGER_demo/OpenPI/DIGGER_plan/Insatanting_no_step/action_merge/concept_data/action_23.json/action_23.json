    "The merged action for the tasks with the action name \"grind\" should be designed to handle the general task of grinding, combining the preconditions and effects of the original actions in a simple and efficient manner. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action grind ; Grind ingredients using a tool\n  :parameters (?p - player ?tool - tool ?ing - ingredients)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?tool) (clean ?tool) (empty ?tool) (separate ?ing))\n  :effect (and (full ?tool) (dirty ?tool) (mixed ?ing))\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action is designed to be adaptable to various grinding tasks by using abstract parameters:\n\n- The `?tool` parameter can represent any tool used for grinding, increasing the generality of the action.\n- The preconditions ensure that the player is at the tool, the tool is clean and empty, and the ingredients are separate before grinding.\n- The effects describe the state changes: the tool becomes full and dirty, and the ingredients become mixed.\n\nThis approach maintains the core logic of the original actions, avoids redundancy, and ensures logical consistency across different contexts.",
    "(:action mix ; Mix items and update their states\n  :parameters (?actor - entity ?tool - tool ?item - mixable)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?tool) (full ?tool) (dirty ?tool) (not (mixed ?item)))\n  :effect (mixed ?item))\n",
    "(:action transfer ; Transfer an item from one container to another\n:parameters (?p - person ?source - container ?destination - container ?item - object)\n:precondition (and (at ?p ?source) (contains ?source ?item) (not (contains ?destination ?item)) (empty ?destination))\n:effect (and (not (contains ?source ?item)) (contains ?destination ?item) (empty ?source))\n)",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we need to create an action that is abstract enough to cover the parameters and conditions involved in the tasks yet specific enough to capture the state changes. Here\u2019s the merged action based on the given examples:\n\n### Action name after merge: pour\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n1. **pour_into_air_tight_container**:\n    ```pddl\n    (:action pour_into_air_tight_container\n      :parameters (?p - player ?c - container ?a - air_tight_container ?ing - ingredients)\n      :precondition (and (at ?p ?c) (full ?c) (thoroughly_mixed ?ing) (empty ?a))\n      :effect (and (full ?a) (empty ?c) (air_tight ?a))\n    )\n    ```\n\n### The merged action is:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?source - container ?destination - container ?content - substance)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?source) (full ?source) (thoroughly_mixed ?content) (empty ?destination))\n  :effect (and (full ?destination) (empty ?source) (air_tight ?destination))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The `?actor` parameter can be any agent (player or NPC).\n   - The `?source` and `?destination` parameters are generalized to `container` to cover a wide range of tasks.\n   - The `?content` parameter is generalized to `substance` to accommodate different types of contents being poured.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions clearly state the required conditions before the action: the agent must be at the source container, the source container must be full, the content must be thoroughly mixed, and the destination container must be empty.\n   - Effects clearly describe the state change after the action: the destination container becomes full, the source container becomes empty, and the destination container becomes airtight.\n   \n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar conditions and effects into a single, efficient action.\n   \n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical consistency of preconditions and effects is maintained across different contexts, ensuring that the merged action is reasonable and applicable to a variety of tasks.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of pouring content from one container to another while ensuring that the action is adaptable to a wide range of situations and maintains logical consistency."

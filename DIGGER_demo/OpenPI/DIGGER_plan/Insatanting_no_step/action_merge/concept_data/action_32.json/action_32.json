    "Given the guidelines and the examples provided, here's the merged action for the \"throw\" task:\n\n```pddl\n(:action throw ; Throw an item into a container\n :parameters (?item - object ?actor - agent ?start_loc - location ?end_loc - location ?container - container)\n :precondition (and (at ?item ?start_loc) (at ?actor ?start_loc) (at ?container ?end_loc))\n :effect (and (not (at ?item ?start_loc)) (at ?item ?container) (full ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action is designed to be general and applicable to various tasks involving throwing or moving items. It uses abstract parameters (`?item`, `?actor`, `?start_loc`, `?end_loc`, `?container`) to ensure broad applicability.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the state changes\u2014an item is moved from a start location to a container at the end location, and the container becomes full.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining the core logic of the original actions and removing unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring that they are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the essential elements of the original actions, allowing for flexible application in various scenarios involving throwing or moving items.",

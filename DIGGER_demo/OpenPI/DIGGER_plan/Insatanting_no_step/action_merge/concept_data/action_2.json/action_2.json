    "The universal action name after the merge is: `move`\n\nThe merged action definition is as follows:\n\n```pddl\n(:action move\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?from - location ?to - location ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?entity ?from) \n        (connected ?from ?context ?to) \n        (not (blocked ?from ?context ?to))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (at ?entity ?to) \n        (not (at ?entity ?from)) \n        (condition_based_effects ?entity ?context ?to)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters like `?entity`, `?context`, `?from`, and `?to` to make it adaptable to various tasks. This ensures it is not limited to specific types of actions and can be applied to different scenarios.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change from one location to another, ensuring that the entity's state is progressively transformed until the goal state is reached.\n3. **Simplicity**: Unnecessary complexities and redundancies have been avoided by combining similar effects and conditions into a single action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic with clear and reasonable preconditions and effects across different tasks. The use of `condition_based_effects` as a placeholder allows for further customization based on specific contexts, ensuring flexibility.\n\n### Condition-Based Effects:\n\nThe placeholder `condition_based_effects` can be expanded or customized as needed based on the specific context and additional effects required for different scenarios. For example, if the entity is a passenger moving into a boat, the effects might include `at_center`, `crouching`, and `still` conditions. This modular approach ensures the action remains adaptable and efficient.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged `move` action is capable of handling a variety of tasks involving movement and state changes in a logical and consistent manner.",
    "Based on the given example and the guidelines, we will merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"board.\" We'll ensure that the action is general enough to apply to various tasks involving boarding, checking preconditions, and updating states. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: Board\n\n```pddl\n(:action board ; Board an entity and update state\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?platform - location ?vehicle - vehicle)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?platform) (at ?vehicle ?platform) (solid_platform ?platform) (not (in ?agent ?vehicle)))\n  :effect (and (in ?agent ?vehicle) (not (at ?agent ?platform)) (heavier ?vehicle))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?platform`, `?vehicle`) that can represent any entity, location, and vehicle, making it adaptable to various boarding tasks.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions: `at ?agent ?platform`, `at ?vehicle ?platform`, `solid_platform ?platform`, and `not (in ?agent ?vehicle)` ensure that the agent and vehicle are at the same platform, the platform is solid, and the agent is not already in the vehicle.\n   - Effects: `in ?agent ?vehicle` indicates the agent is now in the vehicle, `not (at ?agent ?platform)` indicates the agent is no longer at the platform, and `heavier ?vehicle` reflects the change in the state of the vehicle after boarding.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action combines the core logic of boarding and state changes without unnecessary complexity or redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness in various boarding scenarios.\n\nBy merging the actions into this universal \"board\" action, we ensure it remains general, captures the necessary state changes, and retains the core logic while avoiding redundancy and maintaining simplicity.",
    "Given the provided actions and their descriptions, we can merge the actions into a single, universal action called `hold`. This action will generalize the process of holding a rail and steadying the boat to accommodate different tasks in a boat boarding scenario.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action hold\n    :parameters (?p - passenger ?b - boat ?r - rail ?d - dock ?other_passenger - passenger)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?d) \n        (in ?p ?b) \n        (has_rails ?b) \n        (boarding ?other_passenger ?b)\n        (not (holding ?p ?r))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (holding ?p ?r) \n        (steady ?b) \n        (not (rocking ?b))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `hold` uses abstract parameters (`?p`, `?b`, `?r`, `?d`, `?other_passenger`) that are adaptable to various tasks involving holding and steadying.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the passenger is at the dock, in the boat, and the boat has rails. The effects ensure that the passenger is holding the rail, and the boat is steady.\n- **Simplicity**: The action combines the core logic of holding the rail and keeping the boat steady into a single action, avoiding redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action efficiently captures the necessary steps and conditions for boarding a small boat safely and effectively, following the guidelines provided."

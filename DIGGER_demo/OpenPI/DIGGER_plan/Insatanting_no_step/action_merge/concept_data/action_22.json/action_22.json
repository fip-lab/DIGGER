    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, here is the merged action for \"store\":\n\n**Action name after merge: store**\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n\n1. **store_in_linen_closet**\n```pddl\n(:action store_in_linen_closet\n  :parameters (?t - towel ?l - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?t folded_in_half_twice) (at ?l linen_closet))\n  :effect (and (not (at ?t folded_in_half_twice)) (at ?t stored_in_closet))\n)\n```\n\n**Merged Action:**\n```pddl\n(:action store ; Store an item and update its state\n  :parameters (?item - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (prepared_for_storage ?item) (at ?loc storage_area))\n  :effect (and (not (prepared_for_storage ?item)) (at ?item stored_in_location))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters (?item - object, ?loc - location) to ensure it can adapt to various tasks, not just storing towels. This increases its applicability to a broader range of scenarios involving storing different items.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the item's state from being prepared for storage to being stored in a location. This ensures a clear and logical progression towards the goal state.\n3. **Simplicity:** By focusing on the core logic of storing an item and updating its state, the merged action avoids unnecessary complexity and redundancy.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring that the action is reasonable and applicable in different contexts. The preconditions ensure the item is prepared for storage, and the effects update the item's state to reflect it being stored in a specified location.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the original action while maintaining flexibility and simplicity, making it adaptable to various storage-related tasks.",
    "To merge the example actions provided into a single universal action named \"unfold,\" while maintaining generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency, we'll create an abstract and adaptable action. Here's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action unfold ; Unfold an item and update its state\n    :parameters (?item - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?item stored) (at ?location available))\n    :effect (and (not (at ?item stored)) (at ?item unfolded_at_location))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The action uses abstract parameters (`?item` and `?location`) to ensure it can apply to various objects and locations, not just towels and towel racks.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transition of the item's state from being stored to being unfolded at a specific location.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity while capturing the core logic of unfolding and positioning the item.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring the action can be applied to various tasks involving unfolding and positioning items.\n\nThis merged action effectively represents the process of unfolding an item and updating its state, making it adaptable to a wide range of scenarios."

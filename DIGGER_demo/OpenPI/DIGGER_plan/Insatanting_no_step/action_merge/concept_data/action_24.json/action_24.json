    "Based on the guidelines provided and the specific action sets given, here is the merged PDDL action for \"scrub\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action scrub ; Scrub an item to clean it\n  :parameters (?actor - person ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (cleanness ?item dirty))\n  :effect (and (cleanness ?item clean) (wetness ?item wet))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters `?actor` (person) and `?item` (object) to ensure it can be adapted to a variety of tasks, not limited to a specific type of item or actor. This makes the action applicable in multiple contexts where cleaning or scrubbing is required.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(cleanness ?item dirty)` and the effect `(cleanness ?item clean) (wetness ?item wet)` clearly describe the state change, transforming the item's state from dirty to clean and wet.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The action retains the core logic of preconditions and effects necessary for the task of scrubbing and cleaning, without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - The action is simplified to avoid redundancy by focusing on the essential preconditions and effects needed to describe the scrubbing action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different tasks involving scrubbing and cleaning, ensuring clarity in their application.\n\nThis merged action \"scrub\" can now be used in various scenarios where an item needs to be cleaned, maintaining simplicity and efficiency while capturing the necessary state changes.",
    "Here's the merged action based on the given guidelines:\n\n### Action name after merge: place\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action place ; Place an item in a designated location and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (available ?item) (not (placed ?item ?loc)))\n  :effect (and (placed ?item ?loc) (status ?item updated) (status ?loc updated))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action is designed to be adaptable to various tasks involving placing an item in a location. Abstract parameters such as `?item` and `?loc` are used to maintain flexibility across different scenarios.\n\n2. **State Change**: The action clearly describes the state change. It changes the status of the item and the location, indicating the progression towards the goal state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: By merging the actions with similar effects, the action avoids redundancy and maintains simplicity and efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logical and consistent, ensuring that the action can be reasonably applied in different contexts.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action `place` effectively combines the original actions into a single, adaptable, and efficient action.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"replace,\" we need to ensure the action is general enough to apply to various tasks involving replacing, modifying, or placing items, while clearly reflecting state changes and maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n### Action name after merge: replace\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n```pddl\n(:action replace-lid-label\n    :parameters (?p - player ?b - bottle ?lid - lid ?label - label)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (emptiness ?b full) (cleanness ?b clean) (wetness ?b wet))\n    :effect (and (orientation ?b closed_with_lid) (clarity ?b written_on))\n)\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Place the bottle in the refrigerator.\n```pddl\n(:action place_in_refrigerator\n    :parameters (?p - player ?b - bottle ?r - refrigerator)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (orientation ?b closed_with_lid) (clarity ?b written_on))\n    :effect (in ?b ?r)\n)\n```\n\n### The actions after the merger are:\n```pddl\n(:action replace\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?new_state - state ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (not (state ?item ?new_state)))\n    :effect (and (state ?item ?new_state) (in ?item ?location))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n**Generality:** The action uses abstract parameters (`?item`, `?new_state`, `?location`) to adapt to various tasks involving replacement or placement of items.\n\n**State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The precondition checks if the player is in the kitchen and if the item is not already in the new state. The effect updates the state of the item and places it in the specified location.\n\n**Simplicity:** The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the state changes into a single effect, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n\n**Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, with clear and reasonable preconditions and effects that can be applied to various contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"replace\" efficiently captures the essence of the individual actions and can be applied to a variety of tasks, ensuring generality, clarity, and simplicity."

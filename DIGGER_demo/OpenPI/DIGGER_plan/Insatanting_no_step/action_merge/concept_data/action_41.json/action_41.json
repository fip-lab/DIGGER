    "Given the task of merging the provided actions into a single, universal PDDL action, we will create a merged action named `wash`. This action will be designed to handle the cleaning of various types of clothing and gear, ensuring it captures the core logic, state changes, and generality required.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action wash\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?wm - washing_machine)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?p ?item)\n    (at ?p ?wm)\n    (knowledge instructions read)\n    (cleanness ?item dirty)\n    (or (type ?item gore_tex)\n        (type ?item synthetic)\n        (type ?item polar_fleece))\n    (or (not (type ?item polar_fleece))\n        (and (type ?item polar_fleece)\n             (fullness ?wm empty)\n             (electric_conductivity ?wm off)))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (cleanness ?item clean)\n    (when (type ?item polar_fleece)\n      (and (fullness ?wm full_with_polar_fleece)\n           (electric_conductivity ?wm on)))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n1. **Action Name:** `wash`\n2. **Parameters:**\n   - `?p` - person\n   - `?item` - object (generalized to cover clothing, boots, etc.)\n   - `?wm` - washing machine\n\n3. **Preconditions:**\n   - The person `?p` must be at the location of the item `?item` and the washing machine `?wm`.\n   - The person `?p` must have read the washing instructions (generalized).\n   - The item `?item` must be dirty.\n   - The item `?item` must be of type `gore_tex`, `synthetic`, or `polar_fleece`.\n   - If the item is of type `polar_fleece`, additional preconditions must be met:\n     - The washing machine `?wm` must be empty.\n     - The washing machine `?wm` must be off.\n\n4. **Effects:**\n   - The item `?item` becomes clean.\n   - Additional effects if the item is of type `polar_fleece`:\n     - The washing machine `?wm` is now full with polar fleece.\n     - The washing machine `?wm` is turned on.\n\nThis merged action successfully combines the original actions into a single, universal action that maintains logical consistency, avoids redundancy, and clearly describes the state changes for various types of gear.",
    "Based on the provided actions that need to be merged, here's a universal action named `clean` that captures the general essence of cleaning different types of items while ensuring logical consistency and simplicity:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?location - place ?wm - washing_machine)\n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?p ?item)\n    (cleanness ?item dirty)\n    (or \n      (and (type ?item synthetic) (not (contains ?item polar_fleece)))\n      (and (type ?item jacket) (contains ?item down))\n      (and (type ?item polar_fleece) (at ?p ?wm) (at ?item ?wm) (knowledge instructions read) (fullness ?wm empty) (electric_conductivity ?wm off))\n    )\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (cleanness ?item clean)\n    (when (type ?item polar_fleece) \n      (and (fullness ?wm full_with_polar_fleece) (electric_conductivity ?wm on))\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action `clean` is designed to handle various cleaning tasks with different types of items such as synthetic boots, synthetic jackets with down, and polar fleece items. The preconditions and effects are structured to reflect the necessary checks and state changes required for each specific type of cleaning task. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the components:\n\n1. **Parameters:**\n   - `?p` - person performing the action.\n   - `?item` - object to be cleaned.\n   - `?location` - place where the cleaning is happening (if needed, for context).\n   - `?wm` - washing machine (used specifically for polar fleece items).\n\n2. **Preconditions:**\n   - The person must be at the location of the item.\n   - The item must be dirty.\n   - Different conditions based on the type of item:\n     - For synthetic items (excluding polar fleece), only check if the item is synthetic.\n     - For synthetic jackets with down, additionally check if the jacket contains down.\n     - For polar fleece items, ensure the person and item are both at the washing machine, the instructions have been read, the washing machine is empty, and it\u2019s off.\n\n3. **Effects:**\n   - The item becomes clean.\n   - Additional effects for polar fleece items include updating the washing machine's state to full and turning it on.\n\nThis general approach ensures that the action is applicable to a variety of cleaning tasks while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency."

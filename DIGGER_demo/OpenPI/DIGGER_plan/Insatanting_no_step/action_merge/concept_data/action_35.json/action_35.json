    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action called \"place,\" we should ensure that the action is general enough to be applied to various tasks involving placing items, and also clearly reflect the state changes with simplicity and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action place\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?container - object)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?item1) (at ?p ?container) (or (empty ?container) (holding_flour_and_salt ?container)) (or (not (flattened ?item1)) (inventory ?p ?item2)))\n    :effect (and \n        (or (holding_flour_and_salt ?container) (flattened ?item1) (mixed_with_oil ?container) (on_wax_paper ?item1))\n        (not (empty ?container))\n        (not (inventory ?p ?item1))\n        (or (mixed ?item1 ?item2) (on_wax_paper ?item1))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is named \"place\" to generalize the task of placing items into a container or onto another object.\n   - Abstract parameters (`?item1`, `?item2`, `?container`) are used to make the action adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects reflect the change in state, such as placing items into a container, flattening pastry, or mixing ingredients.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar state changes under one action.\n   - The action remains simple and efficient by summarizing the preconditions and effects needed for different tasks.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects that can logically apply to different contexts.\n\nBy merging the actions in this manner, we create a versatile and adaptable PDDL action suitable for a variety of placing tasks in different scenarios.",
    "To merge the provided action sets into a single universal action named `remove`, we need to ensure that the merged action is general, reflects state changes clearly, maintains simplicity, and is logically consistent. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action remove\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object ?container - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?container) (in_container ?item ?container))\n    :effect (and (not (in_container ?item ?container)) (at ?item ?agent))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters have been abstracted to be adaptable to a variety of tasks. `?agent` is used for any entity performing the action, `?item` for any object being removed, and `?container` for any location or container from which the item is being removed.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The item moves from being in the container to being held by the agent.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity, ensuring that it is simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic, ensuring the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action `remove` can now be used in various scenarios where an item needs to be removed from a container, making it very versatile and reusable.",
    "Here is the merged action for the \"press\" task, incorporating the given actions and ensuring generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n```pddl\n(:action press ; Press an item into a container or surface\n    :parameters (?p - agent ?item - object ?surface - surface)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?item) (prepared ?item) (at ?p ?surface))\n    :effect (and (pressed ?item ?surface) (not (prepared ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstract, using `?p - agent`, `?item - object`, and `?surface - surface` to allow the action to be adaptable to various types of pressing tasks, not limited to pastries and pie dishes.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(prepared ?item)` abstracts the state of the item being ready for pressing (e.g., flattened pastry).\n   - The effect `(pressed ?item ?surface)` represents the result of the pressing action (e.g., pastry in the pie dish).\n   - The effect `(not (prepared ?item))` signifies the change in state after pressing.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into a single, efficient action with abstract parameters.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring that the action maintains consistent logic across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"press\" is now a universal action that can be used to represent various tasks involving pressing an item into a surface or container, such as pressing pastry into a pie dish or any other similar task.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and the example action sets, here\u2019s how the merged action for \"create\" can be constructed:\n\n### Merged Action: Create\n\n#### Original Actions to be Merged:\n1. **create_edge_with_fork**\n   ```\n   (:action create_edge_with_fork\n       :parameters (?p - player ?pastry - dough ?fork - utensil)\n       :precondition (and (in_pie_dish ?pastry) (inventory ?p ?fork) (at ?p ?pastry))\n       :effect (edged_with_fork ?pastry)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action: Create\n\n#### Merged Action:\n```\n(:action create\n  :parameters (?actor - person ?item - object ?tool - object)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?actor ?tool) (at ?actor ?item) (not (created ?item)))\n  :effect (created ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstracted as `?actor`, `?item`, and `?tool` to fit a wide range of tasks, not limited to specific types of objects or actions.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state. For instance, the item must be in the actor's inventory and at the actor's location before the action can be performed. After the action, the item is marked as `created`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by merging similar actions into one general action. This decreases complexity and increases efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logic is consistent and retains necessary preconditions and effects across different contexts. The action ensures that the actor has the tool and is at the location of the item before creating it.\n\n### Example of Usage:\n- This `create` action can now be used to describe making edges with a fork for pastry, as well as other creation tasks like crafting an item with a tool in various contexts.\n\n### Application:\n\nTo use the `create` action in different scenarios, you just need to specify the appropriate `?actor`, `?item`, and `?tool`. For example:\n\n- Creating edges for a pastry with a fork:\n  ```\n  (:action create\n    :parameters (?p - player ?pastry - dough ?fork - utensil)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?fork) (at ?p ?pastry) (not (created ?pastry)))\n    :effect (created ?pastry)\n  )\n  ```\n\n- Assembling a bookshelf with a screwdriver:\n  ```\n  (:action create\n    :parameters (?p - person ?bookshelf - furniture ?screwdriver - tool)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?screwdriver) (at ?p ?bookshelf) (not (created ?bookshelf)))\n    :effect (created ?bookshelf)\n  )\n  ```\n\nBy using the merged `create` action, you can cover a wide variety of creation tasks with a single, adaptable action."

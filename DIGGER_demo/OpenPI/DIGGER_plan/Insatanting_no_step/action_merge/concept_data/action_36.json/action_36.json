    "Based on the provided guidelines, the merged action for placing objects in various locations and containers can be defined as follows:\n\n```lisp\n(:action place ; Place an item in a specific location or container\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n        (inventory ?p ?item)\n        (or (container ?location) (freezer ?location) (shelf ?location))\n        (not (in_location ?item ?location))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (in_location ?item ?location)\n        (when (container ?location) (airtight ?location))\n        (when (freezer ?location) (frozen ?item))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is designed to handle placing items into any location type, such as containers, freezers, or shelves. \n   - The parameters are abstract (`?item`, `?location`), making this action adaptable to various tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the player has the item in their inventory and verifies if the target location is a valid place (container, freezer, or shelf) and that the item is not already in the location.\n   - The effect updates the item's state to being in the specified location and adds additional properties based on the type of location (e.g., airtight for containers and frozen for freezers).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Combined the logic of placing an item in a container and a freezer into a single action to avoid redundancy.\n   - Removed unnecessary complexity by using conditional effects (using `when` statements) to handle location-specific state changes.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains a clear and reasonable set of preconditions and effects that are consistent across different contexts (placing in a container, freezer, or shelf).\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action efficiently captures the essence of placing an item in various types of locations while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.",
    "(:action separate ; Separate items using a specified method\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?items - object ?method - method)\n  :precondition (and (in_container ?items ?container) (not (separated ?items)))\n  :effect (separated ?items)\n)",
    "The merged action should encompass the essential steps involved in freezing and thawing cookies, making it adaptable to various scenarios involving state changes of entities. Here's the universal action that combines the relevant actions for thawing cookies:\n\n### Action: thaw\n\n```pddl\n(:action thaw\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?location1 - location ?location2 - location)\n  :precondition (and (in ?item ?location1) (frozen ?item))\n  :effect (and (not (in ?item ?location1)) (thawed ?item) (in ?item ?location2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The action uses abstract parameters `?item` (object), `?location1` (initial location), and `?location2` (target location) to make it applicable to various tasks that involve thawing an item from one location and moving it to another.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the item is in a frozen state and located in the initial location. The effects describe the item being thawed and transferred to the target location.\n- **Core Logic:** The preconditions and effects capture the essential logic of checking for the frozen state and updating the item's location and state without unnecessary complexity.\n- **Avoid Redundancy:** Similar actions such as placing items in a container or separating them with paper are not included, as they do not directly pertain to the thawing process.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable for thawing items.\n\nThis universal action for thawing items can be adapted to various scenarios, making it efficient and straightforward while covering the necessary state changes."

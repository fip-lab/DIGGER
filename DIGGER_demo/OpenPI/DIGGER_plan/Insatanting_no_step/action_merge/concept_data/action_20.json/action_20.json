    "Based on the given guidelines and the provided example, the merged action for \"crumple\" should maintain generality, simplicity, logical consistency, and clear state changes. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action crumple\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?item) (state ?item flat))\n    :effect (and (state ?item crumpled) (not (state ?item flat)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters have been made abstract (?agent and ?item) to ensure that the action can apply to various tasks involving different agents and items, not just specific to crumpling a paper.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the state transformation from flat to crumpled.\n- **Simplicity**: Unnecessary complexity is avoided by merging only relevant preconditions and effects.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logically consistent with the action of crumpling an item, ensuring that the state change is reasonable.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various scenarios where an agent interacts with an object to change its state from flat to crumpled.",

    "Here is the merged PDDL action named \"complete\", which integrates the logic from the provided actions while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n**Merged Action:**\n```pddl\n(:action complete ; Complete a task and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?task - object)\n  :precondition (and (status ?task in_progress))\n  :effect (and (status ?task completed) (not (status ?task in_progress)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"complete\" uses abstract parameters (`?p - person` and `?task - object`) to make it applicable to a variety of tasks, not limited to specific actions like making a wreath.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, showing the transition of the task status from \"in_progress\" to \"completed\".\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundancy.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic, with clear and reasonable preconditions and effects applicable across different contexts.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action \"complete\" is adaptable to various tasks involving the completion of an item or task and updating its status accordingly.",

    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action named `adjust`, we need to ensure that the merged action is general, captures state changes clearly, retains core logic without unnecessary complexity, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here's how we can achieve that:\n\n### Merged Action for \"adjust\"\n\n#### Objective:\nThe merged action should be able to adjust various resources or states, reflecting changes in the entity's condition.\n\n#### Action Sets to Merge:\n- `adjust_paper`: Adjusting the state of a paper on a hanger.\n\n#### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action adjust\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?item - object ?state_from - state ?state_to - state)\n    :precondition (and (at ?entity ?item) (state ?item ?state_from))\n    :effect (and (state ?item ?state_to) (not (state ?item ?state_from)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Abstract Parameters**: The parameters `?entity`, `?item`, `?state_from`, and `?state_to` are abstract and can be adapted to various tasks beyond just adjusting paper. This makes the action applicable to different entities and items requiring state changes.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: The precondition `(at ?entity ?item)` ensures that the entity is at the location of the item that needs adjustment. The precondition `(state ?item ?state_from)` ensures that the item is currently in the state that needs changing.\n   - **Effects**: The effect `(state ?item ?state_to)` sets the new state of the item, and `(not (state ?item ?state_from))` removes the old state, clearly reflecting the state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action encapsulates the core logic of state transition without unnecessary complexity or redundant conditions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - **Preconditions and Effects**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring that the action can be applied in various contexts where state changes are required. This consistency ensures that the action is reasonable and clear in different tasks.\n\n### Example Usage:\n- Adjusting the state of a paper on a hanger:\n  ```pddl\n  (:action adjust_paper\n      :parameters (?p - person ?hanger - hanger ?paper - paper)\n      :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (state ?paper threaded_on_hanger))\n      :effect (and (state ?paper scrunched) (not (state ?paper crumpled)))\n  )\n  ```\n  This specific action can be represented by the merged action as:\n  ```pddl\n  (:action adjust\n      :parameters (?p - person ?hanger - hanger ?paper - paper ?state_from - state ?state_to - state)\n      :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (state ?paper threaded_on_hanger))\n      :effect (and (state ?paper scrunched) (not (state ?paper crumpled)))\n  )\n  ```\n\nBy following the outlined guidelines and ensuring that the merged action is general, clear, simple, and logically consistent, the `adjust` action can be effectively used in various contexts requiring state adjustments."

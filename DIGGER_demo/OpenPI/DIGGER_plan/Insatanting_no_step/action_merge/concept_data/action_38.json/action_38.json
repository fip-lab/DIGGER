    "Given the objective of combining the PDDL actions into a single universal action, we need to ensure that this action can adapt to various shooting scenarios involving different weapons. We'll generalize the parameters and conditions while maintaining the core logic. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action shoot ; Shoot at an enemy's head with a weapon\n  :parameters (?p - player ?w - weapon ?e - enemy)\n  :precondition (and \n    (aiming_at_head ?p ?w ?e)\n    (or (weapon_type ?w sniper)\n        (weapon_type ?w shotgun)\n        (and (weapon_type ?w pistol) (shots_fired ?p ?w 6))\n        (and (weapon_type ?w boomshot) (chance_headshot ?p ?w 0.000001))\n    )\n  )\n  :effect (headshot ?e)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The parameters `?p`, `?w`, and `?e` are abstract and can represent any player, weapon, and enemy respectively. The `weapon_type` predicate is used to indicate the type of weapon being used.\n\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions reflect the necessary conditions for a headshot based on the weapon type, and the effect is the `headshot` of the enemy.\n\n3. **Core Logic:** The core logic of each weapon's shooting condition is retained:\n   - Sniper and shotgun just need to aim at the head.\n   - Pistol requires 6 shots to the head.\n   - BoomShot has a very low chance of a headshot.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:** By using the `weapon_type` predicate and `or` conditions, we avoid redundancy and keep the action simple and efficient.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts and weapons, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action allows for different shooting scenarios to be handled with a single, adaptable action, maintaining simplicity and efficiency."

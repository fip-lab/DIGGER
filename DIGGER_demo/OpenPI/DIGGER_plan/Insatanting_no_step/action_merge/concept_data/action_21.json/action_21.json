    "Given the actions you provided, the goal is to create a merged action called \"select\" that encompasses the functionalities of selecting a plant, a container, and soil. Here's how we can combine these actions into a single universal action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action select\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc)\n        (or \n            (and (unselected ?loc) (in_garden ?item))\n            (and (in_cabinet ?item) (empty ?item))\n            (in_bag ?item)\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or \n            (and (selected ?loc) (in_hand ?p ?item) (not (in_garden ?item)))\n            (and (on_countertop ?item) (not (in_cabinet ?item)))\n            (and (in_container ?p ?item) (not (in_bag ?item)))\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n**Generality**: By using abstract parameters such as `?item` and `?loc`, the action `select` can be applied to various tasks such as selecting a plant, container, or soil.\n\n**State Change**: The preconditions and effects are designed to reflect the change in state for each different item type.\n\n- For selecting a plant: \n  - Preconditions: The player is at the garden center, the garden center is unselected, and the plant is in the garden.\n  - Effects: The garden center becomes selected, the player has the plant in hand, and the plant is no longer in the garden.\n  \n- For selecting a container:\n  - Preconditions: The player is at the location, the container is in the cabinet, and the container is empty.\n  - Effects: The container is now on the countertop and is no longer in the cabinet.\n  \n- For selecting soil:\n  - Preconditions: The player is at the location, and the soil is in the bag.\n  - Effects: The soil is now in the container and is no longer in the bag.\n\n**Simplicity and Efficiency**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and ensuring the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n**Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency for each type of selection, ensuring clear and reasonable transitions between states.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to the tasks you described while maintaining a coherent and logical structure.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action named `water`, we will follow the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the combined action:\n\n### Objective\nTo merge actions related to watering tasks into a single, universal action that can handle a variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states.\n\n### Action name after merge: water\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n1. **water_plant**\n```pddl\n(:action water_plant\n    :parameters (?p - player ?plant - fir ?container - container ?water - water)\n    :precondition (and (in_container ?plant ?container) (dry ?plant))\n    :effect (and (wet ?plant) (not (dry ?plant)))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action water ; Water a plant or container with a specified resource\n    :parameters (?agent - player ?target - object ?container - container ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and (in_container ?target ?container) (dry ?target) (available ?resource))\n    :effect (and (wet ?target) (not (dry ?target)) (used ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The `water` action is designed to be abstract and adaptable. It uses parameters such as `?agent` (player), `?target` (object), `?container` (container), and `?resource` (resource) to generalize the action.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. For example, a target object in a container that is dry becomes wet, and the resource used becomes marked as \"used\".\n3. **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects into a single, concise definition.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions ensure that the target is within a container, the target is dry, and the resource is available. The effects logically follow, ensuring the target is wet and the resource is marked as used.\n\nThis merged `water` action should be applicable to a variety of tasks involving watering or similar actions, maintaining consistency and simplicity while being adaptable to different scenarios.",
    "To merge the given action into a single universal action that adheres to the specified guidelines, we should focus on maintaining generality, clearly reflecting the state change, ensuring simplicity, and maintaining logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action plant\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?plant - plant ?container - container ?soil - soil)\n    :precondition (and (in_hand ?agent ?plant) (in_container ?agent ?soil) (empty ?container))\n    :effect (and (in_container ?plant ?container) (not (in_hand ?agent ?plant)) (not (empty ?container)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters have been generalized to abstract terms, such as `?agent` instead of `?p - player` and `?plant` instead of `?plant - fir`. This allows the action to be applicable to a wider range of tasks involving planting any type of plant, not just firs.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The preconditions check if the agent has the plant in hand, if the agent has soil in a container, and if the container is empty. The effects describe the plant being placed in the container, the agent no longer having the plant in hand, and the container no longer being empty.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward and devoid of unnecessary complexity. It combines the essential parts of the original action, making it efficient while avoiding redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions are reasonable and the effects logically follow from them. The action can be used in various contexts of planting without any contradictions.\n\nThis universal action `plant` can now be used for various planting tasks, adhering to the principles of generality, clear state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "(:action repot\n  :parameters (?agent - player ?entity - object ?from - container ?to - container)\n  :precondition (and (in_container ?entity ?from) (empty ?to))\n  :effect (and (in_container ?entity ?to) (not (in_container ?entity ?from)))\n)\n\n(:action garden\n  :parameters (?agent - player ?entity - object ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?agent) (not (utilized ?resource)))\n  :effect (utilized ?resource)\n)\n\n; Explanation:\n; The `repot` action combines the necessary steps for re-potting a plant into a new container. The parameters are made abstract to apply to any entity (e.g., plant) and any containers.\n; The `garden` action encompasses general gardening tasks like selecting a plant, choosing a container, selecting soil, planting, and watering the plant. It uses abstract parameters to apply to multiple resources and ensures that resources are utilized efficiently without redundancy."

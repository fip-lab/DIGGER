Standardized variable types: Unified \"entity\" and \"object\" into \"entity\" for consistency.\n2. Ensured logical consistency: Added missing closing parentheses and corrected the structure of the effects.\n3. Ensured each action has logically valid preconditions and effects: Fixed the recycle action's effects to handle both attached and removed conditions properly."

    "To generate PDDL actions for the task \"Get Wailord in Pok\u00e9mon Emerald,\" we need to break down each step into a corresponding PDDL action, considering the provided descriptions and entity states. Let's proceed with the steps and create the actions accordingly:\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n#### Step 1: Train Wailmer\n\n```pddl\n(:action train_wailmer\n    :parameters (?w - wailmer ?player - player)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?w) (untrained ?w))\n    :effect (and (trained ?w) (not (untrained ?w)))\n)\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Go to Battle Frontier and Copy Rare Candies\n\n```pddl\n(:action go_to_battle_frontier\n    :parameters (?player - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?player ?loc1) (connected ?loc1 battle_frontier ?loc2))\n    :effect (and (at ?player ?loc2) (not (at ?player ?loc1)))\n)\n\n(:action copy_rare_candies\n    :parameters (?player - player ?candies - rare_candies)\n    :precondition (and (at ?player battle_frontier) (uncopied ?candies))\n    :effect (and (copied ?candies) (not (uncopied ?candies)))\n)\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Give Rare Candies to Wailmer\n\n```pddl\n(:action give_rare_candies\n    :parameters (?candies - rare_candies ?w - wailmer ?player - player)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?player ?candies) (inventory ?player ?w) (copied ?candies) (unevolved ?w))\n    :effect (and (not (inventory ?player ?candies)) (evolved ?w) (not (unevolved ?w)))\n)\n```\n\nThese actions capture the process of evolving a Wailmer into a Wailord by training it and using rare candies. Each action includes parameters for the involved entities, preconditions that must be met before the action can occur, and effects that describe the changes resulting from the action."

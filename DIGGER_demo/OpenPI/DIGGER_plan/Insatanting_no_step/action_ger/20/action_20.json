    "Based on the provided task and steps, here are the PDDL actions for making a wreath with clothes hangers:\n\n### Task: Make a Wreath with Clothes Hangers\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Untwist wire hanger and shape into a circle, using pliers as needed.\n2. Gently crumple 3\" squares of wax paper or crepe paper and thread hanger through the center of each square.\n3. When you have threaded enough squares to fill the length of the hanger, gently push squares away from ends and use pliers to twist ends together.\n4. Gently slide squares of paper back toward the joined ends of the wire hanger, scrunching paper more for additional fullness.\n\n#### PDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action untwist_and_shape_hanger\n    :parameters (?p - player ?hanger - hanger ?pliers - pliers)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (at ?p ?pliers) (straight ?hanger) (inventory ?p ?pliers))\n    :effect (and (twisted ?hanger) (not (straight ?hanger)) (shaped ?hanger circle))\n)\n\n(:action crumple_and_thread_squares\n    :parameters (?p - player ?hanger - hanger ?square - paper_square)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (inventory ?p ?square) (shaped ?hanger circle))\n    :effect (and (threaded ?hanger ?square) (not (inventory ?p ?square)))\n)\n\n(:action fill_hanger_with_squares\n    :parameters (?p - player ?hanger - hanger ?square - paper_square)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (threaded ?hanger ?square))\n    :effect (and (filled ?hanger) (not (threaded ?hanger ?square)))\n)\n\n(:action twist_hanger_ends\n    :parameters (?p - player ?hanger - hanger ?pliers - pliers)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (at ?p ?pliers) (inventory ?p ?pliers) (filled ?hanger))\n    :effect (and (ends_twisted ?hanger) (not (filled ?hanger)))\n)\n\n(:action slide_and_scrunch_squares\n    :parameters (?p - player ?hanger - hanger ?square - paper_square)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (ends_twisted ?hanger) (threaded ?hanger ?square))\n    :effect (and (scrunched ?hanger ?square) (not (threaded ?hanger ?square)))\n)\n\n(:action complete_wreath\n    :parameters (?p - player ?hanger - hanger ?wreath - wreath)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hanger) (ends_twisted ?hanger) (scrunched ?hanger ?square))\n    :effect (and (completed ?wreath) (not (ends_twisted ?hanger)) (not (scrunched ?hanger ?square)))\n)\n```\n\n### Entity State Considerations:\n- The hanger starts in a straight shape and is shaped into a circle.\n- Paper squares are crumpled and threaded onto the hanger.\n- The hanger is filled with squares and the ends are twisted together using pliers.\n- The squares are scrunched for fullness.\n- The wreath is completed with the final action.\n\nThese actions capture the logic and sequence necessary to create a wreath using a wire hanger and paper squares, based on the steps and descriptions provided."

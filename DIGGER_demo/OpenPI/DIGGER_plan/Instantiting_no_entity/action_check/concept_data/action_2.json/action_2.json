Standardized variable types:\n   - Unified 'entity' and 'agent' into one type 'agent'.\n   - Unified 'object' and 'entity' into one type 'object'.\n2. Corrected logical inconsistencies:\n   - Added missing closing parenthesis in the 'hold' action.\n   - Ensured all actions have logically valid preconditions and effects.\n   - Added additional effects for the 'hold' action to ensure completeness.\n3. Removed or fixed contradictory or unnecessary conditions:\n   - Ensured all conditions and effects are meaningful and logically consistent."

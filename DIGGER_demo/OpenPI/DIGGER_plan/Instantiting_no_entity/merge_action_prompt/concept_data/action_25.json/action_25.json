The precondition ensures the player has the ingredients and the blender is empty. The effect moves the ingredients into the blender and removes them from the player's inventory.\n\n2. **Action 2: `blend_into_texture`**  \n   This action blends the ingredients into a smooth texture. The precondition ensures the blender contains the correct ingredients and the player is at the blender. The effect marks the blender as blended and the texture as smooth.\n\n3. **Action 3: `add_rum_and_blend`**  \n   This action adds rum to the blended mixture and blends it again. The precondition ensures the player has rum, the blender is blended, and the player is at the blender. The effect adds rum to the blender and marks the mixture as blended with rum.\n\n4. **Action 4: `pour_into_glass`**  \n   This action pours the smoothie into a glass. The precondition ensures the player is at the glass and blender, the glass is empty, and the blender contains the blended smoothie. The effect fills the glass with the smoothie and empties the blender.\n\n5. **Action 5: `garnish_glass`**  \n   This action garnishes the filled glass with a strawberry. The precondition ensures the player has a strawberry, the glass is filled with the smoothie, and the player is at the glass. The effect garnishes the glass with the strawberry and removes the strawberry from the player's inventory.\n\n---\n\nThese actions follow the PDDL structure and align with the task's steps and descriptions.

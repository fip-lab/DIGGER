    "\nYou're a professional AI, and you're able to combine multiple PDDL actions into one universal action. The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:plug\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action plug_in_converter_to_tv ; Plug the HDMI converter into the TV's HDMI input\n    :parameters (?converter - device ?tv - tv)\n    :precondition (and (at ?converter ?tv) (has_hdmi_input ?tv) (not (connected ?converter ?tv)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?converter ?tv))\n)\n\n\n(:action plug_hdmi_into_converter ; Plug the HDMI cord into the HDMI converter\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?converter - device)\n    :precondition (and (at ?hdmi ?converter) (is_hdmi_converter ?converter) (not (connected ?hdmi ?converter)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?converter))\n)\n\n\n(:action plug_converter_to_wii ; Plug the HDMI converter into the Wii's AV Composite Output\n    :parameters (?converter - device ?wii - console)\n    :precondition (and (at ?converter ?wii) (has_av_composite_output ?wii) (is_hdmi_converter ?converter) (not (connected ?converter ?wii)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?converter ?wii))\n)\n\n\n(:action plug_hdmi_into_tv ; Connect the HDMI cord from the converter to the TV\n    :parameters (?hdmi - cable ?tv - tv ?converter - device)\n    :precondition (and (connected ?hdmi ?converter) (connected ?converter ?tv) (has_hdmi_input ?tv) (not (connected ?hdmi ?tv)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?tv))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **`plug_in_converter_to_tv`**: This action represents plugging the HDMI converter into the TV's HDMI input. The preconditions ensure that the converter is at the TV's location, the TV has an HDMI input, and the converter is not already connected. The effect establishes the connection between the converter and the TV.\n\n2. **`plug_hdmi_into_converter`**: This action represents plugging the HDMI cord into the HDMI converter. The preconditions ensure that the HDMI cable is at the converter's location, the converter is an HDMI-compatible device, and the HDMI cable is not already connected. The effect establishes the connection between the HDMI cable and the converter.\n\n3. **`plug_converter_to_wii`**: This action represents plugging the HDMI converter into the Wii's AV Composite Output. The preconditions ensure that the converter is at the Wii's location, the Wii has an AV Composite Output, and the converter is HDMI-compatible. The effect establishes the connection between the converter and the Wii.\n\n4. **`plug_hdmi_into_tv`**: This action represents connecting the HDMI cord from the converter to the TV. The preconditions ensure that the HDMI cord is already connected to the converter, the converter is connected to the TV, and the TV has an HDMI input. The effect establishes the connection between the HDMI cord and the TV.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- The steps provided in the task were restructured to align with the logical sequence of connecting a Wii to an HD TV using an HDMI converter.\n- Irrelevant or redundant steps were omitted or rephrased to match the task descriptions.\n- Preconditions and effects were crafted based on the logical dependencies of the task, ensuring accurate modeling of the process.\n\nLet me know if you need further refinements or additional actions!\nThe actions after the merger are:"

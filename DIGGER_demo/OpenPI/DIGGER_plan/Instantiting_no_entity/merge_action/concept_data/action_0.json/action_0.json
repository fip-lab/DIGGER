The preconditions ensure that the converter is at the TV's location, the TV has an HDMI input, and the converter is not already connected. The effect establishes the connection between the converter and the TV.\n\n2. **`plug_hdmi_into_converter`**: This action represents plugging the HDMI cord into the HDMI converter. The preconditions ensure that the HDMI cable is at the converter's location, the converter is an HDMI-compatible device, and the HDMI cable is not already connected. The effect establishes the connection between the HDMI cable and the converter.\n\n3. **`plug_converter_to_wii`**: This action represents plugging the HDMI converter into the Wii's AV Composite Output. The preconditions ensure that the converter is at the Wii's location, the Wii has an AV Composite Output, and the converter is HDMI-compatible. The effect establishes the connection between the converter and the Wii.\n\n4. **`plug_hdmi_into_tv`**: This action represents connecting the HDMI cord from the converter to the TV. The preconditions ensure that the HDMI cord is already connected to the converter, the converter is connected to the TV, and the TV has an HDMI input. The effect establishes the connection between the HDMI cord and the TV.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- The steps provided in the task were restructured to align with the logical sequence of connecting a Wii to an HD TV using an HDMI converter.\n- Irrelevant or redundant steps were omitted or rephrased to match the task descriptions.\n- Preconditions and effects were crafted based on the logical dependencies of the task, ensuring accurate modeling of the process.\n\nLet me know if you need further refinements or additional actions!"

    "(:action place ; Place an item into a container and update inventory status\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?container - object)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?agent ?item) (inventory ?agent ?container) (airtight ?container))\n  :effect (and (in ?item ?container) (not (inventory ?agent ?item)))\n)",
    "Here's the merged action based on the given action sets, following the guidelines provided:\n\n```lisp\n(:action separate ; Separate items using a specified medium\n  :parameters (?entity - agent ?item - object ?medium - material)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?entity ?medium) (contains ?container ?item) (or (type ?medium type1) (type ?medium type2) (type ?medium type3)))\n  :effect (separated ?item ?medium)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action is named `separate` to imply a general task of separating items using some medium. The parameters are abstract to ensure wide applicability.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. An entity must have the specified medium in their inventory, and the item to be separated must be within a container. The effect marks the item as separated using the medium.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simplified by merging the specific types of paper into abstract types (`type1`, `type2`, `type3`) to avoid redundancy and increase flexibility.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic remains consistent across different tasks by using abstract parameters and ensuring clear preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to various tasks that involve separating items using different types of materials.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we need to adhere to the principles of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action named `freeze`, which combines the `freeze-biscuits` and `thaw` actions:\n\n### Universal Action: `freeze`\n\n```lisp\n(:action freeze\n  ; Universal action to either freeze or thaw items based on their state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?container - container ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and \n    (in ?item ?container)\n    (location ?container ?location)\n    (or (and (not (frozen ?item)) (separated ?item ?paper)) ; Preconditions for freezing\n        (frozen ?item))                                      ; Preconditions for thawing\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (or (and (not (frozen ?item)) (frozen ?item))            ; Effect of freezing\n        (and (frozen ?item) (not (frozen ?item))))           ; Effect of thawing\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?p`, `?item`, `?container`, `?location`) to apply to various tasks involving freezing or thawing.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly define the state changes. If the item is not frozen, it will become frozen (freeze action). If the item is frozen, it will become thawed (thaw action).\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the similar effects of freezing and thawing into one action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects ensure logical consistency by checking the current state of the item and applying the appropriate state change.\n\nThis universal action can adapt to various contexts where items need to be either frozen or thawed, making it versatile and efficient."

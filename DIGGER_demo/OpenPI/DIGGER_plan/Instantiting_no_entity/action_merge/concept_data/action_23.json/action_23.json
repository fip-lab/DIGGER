    "Based on the guidelines provided, here is the merged action for the task \"mix\":\n\n```lisp\n(:action mix ;  Mix items and update state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?location) (has ?p ?item))\n  :effect (and (mixed ?item) (not (has ?p ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `mix` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks involving mixing, not limited to specific items or locations. Abstract parameters are used to increase applicability:\n\n    - `?p` (person) represents the entity performing the action.\n    - `?item` (object) is the item being mixed.\n    - `?location` (place) is the location where the mixing occurs.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The preconditions ensure the person is at the correct location and has the item to be mixed. The effects indicate that the item is now mixed and no longer possessed by the person:\n\n    - `at ?p ?location` ensures the person is in the correct location.\n    - `has ?p ?item` ensures the person has the item to be mixed.\n    - `mixed ?item` indicates the item is now in a mixed state.\n    - `not (has ?p ?item)` indicates the person no longer has the item after mixing.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into a single, efficient action. The use of abstract parameters and clear preconditions/effects maintains simplicity without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. The merged action `mix` can be applied to various scenarios where an item needs to be mixed, reflecting the change in state accurately.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and the action sets, the merged action will be as follows:\n\n**Action name after merge: pour**\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n```\n(:action pour_into_container\n  :parameters (?p - person ?mixture - mixture ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (mixed ?mixture) (has ?p ?mixture) (is_container ?container))\n  :effect (and (in ?mixture ?container) (not (has ?p ?mixture)))\n)\n```\n\n**The actions after the merger are:**\n```\n(:action pour\n  :parameters (?actor - person ?substance - substance ?target - receptacle)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (prepared ?substance) (has ?actor ?substance) (is_receptacle ?target))\n  :effect (and (in ?substance ?target) (not (has ?actor ?substance)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Generality:** The merged action \"pour\" uses abstract parameters (?actor - person, ?substance - substance, ?target - receptacle) to cover a wide range of tasks involving pouring any substance into any receptacle by any person.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state: the substance is poured from the actor to the receptacle, and the actor no longer has the substance.\n- **Simplicity:** The action is simplified by using general terms and avoiding redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic: it requires that the actor is at a particular location, the substance is prepared, the actor has the substance, and the target is a valid receptacle. The effects clearly show the state change.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable to various scenarios involving pouring different substances into different receptacles by different actors, making it a universal and efficient representation of the original actions.",
    "(:action grind ;  Grind an item and update its state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (has ?p ?item) (is_tool ?tool))\n  :effect (and (ground ?item) (not (has ?p ?item)))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?p - person, ?item - object, ?tool - tool) to make it adaptable to various grinding tasks, not limited to specific ingredients or tools.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the item's state from being in possession to being ground.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects, ensuring that the action remains simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains a logical flow, ensuring the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable across different contexts.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action, we need to ensure the merged action is adaptable, encapsulates the state changes, is simple, and maintains logical consistency. Here is the merged action with the considerations laid out:\n\n### Merged Action: gotolocation\n```lisp\n(:action gotolocation\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?current_location) (connected ?current_location ?location))\n  :effect (and \n            (at ?agent ?location)\n            (not (at ?agent ?current_location))\n           )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?agent` - person and `?location` - location) to ensure it can adapt to various tasks involving movement.\n2. **State Change**: The action clearly reflects the state change, where the agent moves from the current location to a new location. The preconditions ensure the agent is at the current location and the locations are connected, while the effects update the agent's location.\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the logic of movement into one concise action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring the action can be applied in different contexts without unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Additional Example of Merged Actions\n\nTo demonstrate the approach, let's consider merging actions for mixing, pouring, and grinding ingredients into a single action related to processing ingredients.\n\n### Merged Action: process_ingredients\n```lisp\n(:action process_ingredients\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?ingredient - ingredient ?container - container ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and (has ?agent ?ingredient) (available ?tool) (available ?container))\n  :effect (and \n            (processed ?ingredient ?tool)\n            (in ?ingredient ?container)\n           )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: This action uses abstract parameters (`?agent` - person, `?ingredient` - ingredient, `?container` - container, and `?tool` - tool) to apply to various ingredient processing tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The action describes the state change where the agent processes the ingredient using the tool and places it into the container.\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: The action combines mixing, grinding, and pouring into one concise action to avoid redundancy.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical preconditions (the agent has the ingredient, and the tool and container are available) and effects (the ingredient is processed and placed in the container) that are consistent across different contexts.\n\nBy following these principles, we can effectively merge multiple PDDL actions into universal actions that are adaptable, clear in state changes, simple, and logically consistent."

    "\nGiven the task to merge the provided actions into a single universal action, we need to ensure the merged action is general, adaptable, and maintains logical consistency. Here\u2019s the merged action for the provided \"remove\" actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action remove ; Remove an attachment and update the state of the involved entities\n  :parameters (?att - attachment ?container - container ?res - resource)\n  :precondition (and (attached ?att ?container) (contains ?container ?res))\n  :effect (and \n            (not (attached ?att ?container)) \n            (processing ?res ?container)\n            (update_state ?res ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - **Parameters**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?att` (attachment), `?container` (container), and `?res` (resource) to apply to various contexts (e.g., bung, oil cap, oil filter).\n   - **Preconditions and Effects**: These are kept abstract and generalized to accommodate different types of attachments and resources.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the attachment is attached to the container and if the container contains the specified resource.\n   - The effect describes the detachment of the attachment and the update of the resource state in the container.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by creating a single action that covers the essential logic found in the individual actions.\n   - The `processing` and `update_state` effects generalize the transformation of the resource state, making the action adaptable to different scenarios.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The precondition and effect logic are consistent across different tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nBy merging the actions in this manner, the universal \"remove\" action can be applied to a variety of tasks involving the removal of attachments and the subsequent state changes of the involved entities.",
    "Let's create a universal action \"screw\" by merging the given action sets. The merged action should be abstract yet maintain the core logic, generality, and simplicity, ensuring it can apply to a variety of similar tasks.\n\n**Action name after merge: screw**\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n\n1. **Action name:** `screw_bung`\n\n   **Parameters:**\n   ```\n   ?b - bung\n   ```\n\n   **Preconditions:**\n   ```\n   (and (not (attached ?b ?ot)) (drained ?o ?ot))\n   ```\n\n   **Effects:**\n   ```\n   (and (attached ?b ?ot))\n   ```\n\n**The actions after the merger are:**\n\n```\n(:action screw ;  Screw an item to another item\n  :parameters (?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?condition - condition)\n  :precondition (and (not (attached ?item1 ?item2)) (?condition ?item2))\n  :effect (and (attached ?item1 ?item2))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?item1 - object`, `?item2 - object`, and `?condition - condition`) to describe a general \"screwing\" action that can apply to various objects and conditions.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly define the state change: an item (`?item1`) is attached to another item (`?item2`) if the specified condition (`?condition`) is met.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids unnecessary complexity by merging similar effects and maintaining a straightforward logic.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable for different contexts where screwing one item to another is required.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to a wide range of tasks where one object needs to be attached to another under certain conditions.",
    "To merge the given PDDL action set into a single universal action named \"fill,\" we need to ensure that the merged action meets the guidelines: generality, state change, simplicity, logical consistency, and avoiding redundancy. Based on the provided example, here's the merged action:\n\n### Universal Merged Action: fill\n\n```pddl\n(:action fill\n    ; Fill a container with a resource\n    :parameters (?container - object ?resource - object ?source - object)\n    :precondition (and (contains ?container ?resource) (attached ?source ?container) (not (filled ?container ?resource)))\n    :effect (filled ?container ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `fill` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks involving filling a container with a resource from a source. The parameters `?container`, `?resource`, and `?source` are abstract enough to cover a wide range of scenarios.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The action requires that the container contains the resource and is attached to the source, and it results in the container being filled with the resource.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining the common elements of the actions into a single, concise action. It ensures efficiency by having a straightforward precondition and effect structure.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied in different contexts without ambiguity.\n\n### Example Task:\n#### Original Task:\n```pddl\n(:action fill_oil\n    :parameters (?ob - oil_bottle ?fc - faucet)\n    :precondition (and (contains ?ob ?o) (attached ?fc ?ob))\n    :effect (and (filled ?ob ?o))\n)\n```\n\n#### Merged Task:\n```pddl\n(:action fill\n    :parameters (?container - oil_bottle ?resource - oil ?source - faucet)\n    :precondition (and (contains ?container ?resource) (attached ?source ?container) (not (filled ?container ?resource)))\n    :effect (filled ?container ?resource)\n)\n```\n\nBy following the guidelines and merging the actions into a single universal action, we create a more adaptable and efficient PDDL action that can be applied to a variety of tasks involving filling containers with resources.",
    "Here is the merged PDDL action for \"get\" that encompasses the different actions related to obtaining and handling oil:\n\n```pddl\n(:action get\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (not (has ?npc ?item)))\n    :effect (and (has ?npc ?item))\n)\n\n(:action handle_oil\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?storage - location ?tank - container)\n    \n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?npc ?storage) \n        (not (open ?storage))\n        (not (empty ?tank))\n        (has ?npc ?oil_cap)\n        (has ?npc ?oil_filter)\n        (not (filled ?tank))\n    )\n    \n    :effect (and \n        (open ?storage)\n        (not (filled ?tank))\n        (empty ?tank)\n        (filled ?tank)\n        (not (has ?npc ?oil_cap))\n        (not (has ?npc ?oil_filter))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"get\" uses abstract parameters `?npc` and `?item` to be adaptable to various tasks involving different entities. The action \"handle_oil\" uses `?npc`, `?storage`, and `?tank` to generalize the handling of oil-related tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. For example, `get` changes the state from `not (has ?npc ?item)` to `has ?npc ?item`, and `handle_oil` covers the process of handling oil, from obtaining components to filling the tank.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The preconditions and effects retain the core logic of the actions without unnecessary complexity. For example, `handle_oil` combines actions like removing the bung, oil cap, and oil filter, and filling the oil.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The actions with similar effects are merged into the \"handle_oil\" action to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The actions maintain logical consistency across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThese merged actions provide a comprehensive approach to handling tasks related to obtaining and managing oil, ensuring simplicity and adaptability to various scenarios."

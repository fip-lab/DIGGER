    "Using the guidelines provided, we will merge the given action into a single universal action called `get`. The merged action will include general parameters to cover multiple tasks, clearly define state changes, and maintain simplicity and logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action get ; Retrieve an item and update the state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?agent - agent ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?entity ?location) (at ?agent ?location) (not (in_inventory ?agent ?entity)))\n  :effect (and (in_inventory ?agent ?entity) (not (at ?entity ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n\n1. **Generality**: The action `get` is designed to be adaptable to various retrieval tasks by using abstract parameters:\n   - `?entity` represents the object being retrieved.\n   - `?agent` represents the person or agent performing the action.\n   - `?location` represents the location where the action takes place.\n\n2. **State Change**: The action describes the state change clearly:\n   - The `precondition` ensures that both the entity and the agent are at the same location and that the entity is not already in the agent's inventory.\n   - The `effect` specifies that the entity is now in the agent's inventory and is no longer at the location.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity:\n   - It merges the concept of retrieving various items into a single abstract action.\n   - It avoids redundancy by using general parameters.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency:\n   - The `precondition` and `effect` are clear and reasonable.\n   - The action ensures that the entity's state is transformed logically from being at a location to being in the agent's inventory.\n\nThis merged action `get` can now be used in various contexts where an agent needs to retrieve an item from a location and update the state accordingly.",
    "Here's the merged action `clean` that captures the core logic from the provided actions while maintaining simplicity, generality, and logical consistency:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean ; Clean a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?agent ?loc)\n    (at ?item ?loc)\n    (or\n      (and (basket ?item) (not (full ?item)))\n      (and (surface ?item) (inventory ?agent cleaning_rag))\n      (room ?item)\n    )\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (or\n      (and (basket ?item) (full ?item) (empty ?basket))\n      (and (surface ?item) (clean ?item))\n      (and (room ?item) (clean ?item))\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The merged action `clean` uses abstract parameters `?agent`, `?item`, and `?loc` to adapt to various cleaning tasks.\n   - It combines the actions for emptying trash, cleaning surfaces, and cleaning rooms.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change for each type of cleaning action.\n   - The conditions ensure that the agent is at the location of the item to be cleaned and that the item is either a basket, surface, or room.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar effects (e.g., cleaning a surface or a room) into a single action.\n   - The action is efficient and straightforward, representing different cleaning tasks under a unified framework.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic for different contexts.\n   - Preconditions ensure the presence of necessary items (e.g., cleaning rag for surfaces, trash not full for baskets).\n   - Effects update the state of the item to reflect it being cleaned or emptied.\n\nBy merging the actions into the universal `clean` action, it is possible to handle various cleaning-related tasks efficiently while maintaining clarity and consistency in the logic.",

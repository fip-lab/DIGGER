This allows the action to be adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(exists (condition ?target))` and the effect `(not (condition ?target))` clearly describe the state change from having a condition to no longer having it. Additionally, `(new_state ?target)` signifies that the entity has entered a new state.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by using broad terms and removing context-specific details while retaining the core logic.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions ensure that the `?actor` must be at the location of `?target` and that `?target` must have a certain condition before the action can be performed. The effects ensure that the condition is removed and the entity is updated to a new state."

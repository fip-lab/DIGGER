    "Sure, let's merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"remove.\" We'll ensure the merged action is general, captures the state change, is simple, and maintains logical consistency.\n\n### Action name after merge: remove\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n1. **Remove wick from a lamp or stove:**\n    ```\n    (:action remove_wick\n        :parameters (?w - wick ?l - lamp ?s - stove)\n        :precondition (and (or (in ?w ?l) (in ?w ?s)))\n        :effect (and (not (in ?w ?l)) (not (in ?w ?s)) (removed ?w))\n    )\n    ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```\n(:action remove ; Generalized remove action\n    :parameters (?item - object ?container1 - container ?container2 - container)\n    :precondition (and (or (in ?item ?container1) (in ?item ?container2)))\n    :effect (and (not (in ?item ?container1)) (not (in ?item ?container2)) (removed ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n    - The parameters are generalized to `?item` and `?container` to make the action adaptable to various tasks involving the removal of items from containers.\n    \n2. **State Change:**\n    - The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to show the state change. The item is removed from either of the containers (`?container1` or `?container2`), and the state of the item is updated to `removed`.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n    - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single, simpler action. The use of abstract parameters helps in avoiding complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n    - The logical flow of preconditions and effects is maintained. The action is applicable in contexts where items need to be removed from containers while ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of scenarios where an item needs to be removed from one or more containers, making it a versatile and efficient action in the PDDL domain.",

    "To merge the actions related to the process of handling wicks into a single universal action, let's focus on capturing the essence of each step while maintaining generality, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere's the universal action after merging the actions:\n\n### Action name after merge: make\n\n```pddl\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?resource - object ?state1 - state ?state2 - state)\n    :precondition (and \n        (current_state ?entity ?state1)\n        (not (current_state ?entity ?state2))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (current_state ?entity ?state2)\n        (not (current_state ?entity ?state1))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity` and `?resource` can be any objects, and `?state1` and `?state2` can be any states), making the action adaptable to various tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change of the entity from `?state1` to `?state2`.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters and focusing on state transitions.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic, ensuring that an entity moves from one state to another without unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Example Application:\n\nTo illustrate how this universal action can be applied, let's map the original actions into this framework:\n\n1. **Pour Vinegar into Container**:\n   - `?entity` = `vinegar`\n   - `?resource` = `container`\n   - `?state1` = `not_in_container`\n   - `?state2` = `in_container`\n\n2. **Remove Wick**:\n   - `?entity` = `wick`\n   - `?resource` = `lamp_or_stove`\n   - `?state1` = `in_lamp_or_stove`\n   - `?state2` = `removed`\n\n3. **Dip Wicks in Vinegar**:\n   - `?entity` = `wick`\n   - `?resource` = `vinegar`\n   - `?state1` = `dry`\n   - `?state2` = `soaked_in_vinegar`\n\n4. **Dry Wicks**:\n   - `?entity` = `wick`\n   - `?resource` = `air`\n   - `?state1` = `soaked_in_vinegar`\n   - `?state2` = `drying`\n\n5. **Make Wicks Dry**:\n   - `?entity` = `wick`\n   - `?resource` = `air`\n   - `?state1` = `drying`\n   - `?state2` = `dry`\n\nBy using the universal `make` action, you can represent a variety of state changes in a coherent and adaptable manner."

    "Here is the merged PDDL action, which combines the essence of squeezing a lemon and using it to clean a faucet, ensuring generality, logical consistency, simplicity, and state progression:\n\n```pddl\n(:action squeeze\n  ; Squeeze a lemon and apply the resulting juice to clean a faucet\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?lemon - object ?juice - object ?faucet - object ?water - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?loc)\n                     (or (and (not (squeezed ?lemon)) (cut ?lemon))\n                         (and (squeezed ?lemon) (at ?faucet ?loc)))\n                     (or (and (squeezed ?lemon) (inventory ?npc ?water) (rubbed ?faucet ?lemon))\n                         (not (squeezed ?lemon))))\n  :effect (and (when (and (cut ?lemon) (not (squeezed ?lemon)))\n                     (and (squeezed ?lemon) (inventory ?npc ?juice)))\n               (when (and (squeezed ?lemon) (at ?faucet ?loc))\n                     (rubbed ?faucet ?lemon))\n               (when (and (squeezed ?lemon) (inventory ?npc ?water) (rubbed ?faucet ?lemon))\n                     (clean ?faucet)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - `?npc - person`: The entity performing the action.\n   - `?lemon - object`: The lemon being squeezed.\n   - `?juice - object`: The juice obtained from the lemon.\n   - `?faucet - object`: The faucet being cleaned.\n   - `?water - object`: Water used for cleaning.\n   - `?loc - location`: The location where the action is performed.\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - The NPC must be at the specified location (`(at ?npc ?loc)`).\n   - If the lemon is not squeezed yet, it must be cut (`(and (not (squeezed ?lemon)) (cut ?lemon))`).\n   - If the lemon is squeezed, the faucet must be at the location (`(squeezed ?lemon) (at ?faucet ?loc)`).\n   - If the faucet has already been rubbed with the lemon, the NPC must have water in their inventory (`(inventory ?npc ?water)`).\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - When the lemon is cut and not yet squeezed, squeezing the lemon results in the NPC having the juice in their inventory (`(squeezed ?lemon) (inventory ?npc ?juice)`).\n   - When the lemon is squeezed and the faucet is at the location, the faucet gets rubbed with the lemon (`(rubbed ?faucet ?lemon)`).\n   - When the faucet is rubbed with the lemon and the NPC has water in their inventory, the faucet becomes clean (`(clean ?faucet)`).\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the sequential steps of squeezing a lemon, using it to rub a faucet, and then cleaning the faucet with water, while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency."

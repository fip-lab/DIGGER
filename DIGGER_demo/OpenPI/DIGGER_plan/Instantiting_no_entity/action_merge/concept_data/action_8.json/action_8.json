    "Based on the given guidelines and the example of the merged action \"check,\" here is the merged action \"start,\" which combines the logic of initializing various tasks into a single universal action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action start ; Start a task or process to update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object)\n  :precondition (not (started ?entity))\n  :effect (started ?entity)\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action \"start\" is designed to be adaptable to a variety of tasks, following the provided guidelines:\n\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (?entity - object) to ensure it can be applied to multiple types of tasks, not just specific ones.\n- **State Change**: The precondition (not (started ?entity)) and the effect (started ?entity) clearly reflect the state change, indicating that the entity moves from a not-started state to a started state.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring the action can be reasonably applied to various contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"start\" now encapsulates the logic of initializing or starting any task or process, making it versatile and applicable to a range of scenarios.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and the example actions, let's merge the given actions into a single universal action named `select`. This action should be general enough to apply to multiple tasks, while ensuring logical consistency and avoiding redundancy.\n\nHere are the original actions:\n\n1. `select_character`\n```pddl\n(:action select_character\n    :parameters (?c - character)\n    :precondition (and (started ?g) (in_cantina ?c))\n    :effect (selected ?c)\n)\n```\n\n2. `save_name_and_exit`\n```pddl\n(:action save_name_and_exit\n    :parameters (?c - character)\n    :precondition (and (selected ?c) (named ?c))\n    :effect (and (saved ?c) (not (selected ?c)))\n)\n```\n\nAfter merging, the universal action `select` should look like this:\n\n```pddl\n(:action select\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and (started ?context) (in_context ?entity ?context) (not (selected ?entity)))\n    :effect (and (selected ?entity) (when (named ?entity) (and (saved ?entity) (not (selected ?entity)))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?entity` (an object that can be selected) and `?context` (the context within which the selection takes place), making it adaptable to various tasks.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The entity is selected if it is in the context and the context has started. If the entity is already named, it is also saved and deselected.\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the effects of both original actions into a single action with conditional logic.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action `select` can now be used in a variety of tasks where an entity needs to be selected, saved, and potentially deselected based on its state.",
    "### Merged Action: `turn`\n\nHere is the merged `turn` action that incorporates the logic and state changes from the provided actions, abstracted to be general enough for various tasks involving activation, selection, customization, and saving states:\n\n```lisp\n(:action turn\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?state - state ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and \n        (available ?entity)\n        (not (in_state ?entity ?state))\n        (contextual_condition ?context ?entity ?state)) \n    :effect (and \n        (in_state ?entity ?state)\n        (contextual_effect ?context ?entity ?state))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Parameters**: The parameters are abstracted to `?entity`, `?state`, and `?context` to allow for various entities (e.g., games, characters) and states (e.g., started, customized, free_play).\n   - **Contextual Condition and Effect**: Abstract `contextual_condition` and `contextual_effect` ensure that the action can be adapted to different contexts and tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: `available ?entity` ensures the entity is available for the action. `not (in_state ?entity ?state)` prevents redundant actions. `contextual_condition ?context ?entity ?state` allows for specific context checks.\n   - **Effects**: `in_state ?entity ?state` changes the entity's state while `contextual_effect ?context ?entity ?state` allows for additional, context-specific state changes.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters and contextual checks, reducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different tasks, ensuring clear and reasonable state changes.\n\n### Example Scenarios\n\n1. **Starting a Game**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action turn\n       :parameters (?game - game ?state - state ?context - context)\n       :precondition (and \n           (available ?game)\n           (not (started ?game))\n           (contextual_condition ?context ?game ?state))\n       :effect (and \n           (started ?game)\n           (contextual_effect ?context ?game ?state))\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Selecting a Character**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action turn\n       :parameters (?character - character ?state - state ?context - context)\n       :precondition (and \n           (available ?character)\n           (not (selected ?character))\n           (contextual_condition ?context ?character ?state))\n       :effect (and \n           (selected ?character)\n           (contextual_effect ?context ?character ?state))\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Customizing a Character**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action turn\n       :parameters (?part - body_part ?state - state ?context - context)\n       :precondition (and \n           (available ?part)\n           (not (customized ?part))\n           (contextual_condition ?context ?part ?state))\n       :effect (and \n           (customized ?part)\n           (contextual_effect ?context ?part ?state))\n   )\n   ```\n\nBy utilizing this universal action template, various specific actions can be instantiated by defining particular entities, states, and context-specific conditions and effects.",
    "Given the guidelines and the provided sets of actions, we need to merge the actions for customizing different pieces of a character into a single, universal action. Let's create a merged `customize` action that retains the core logic and ensures generality, logical consistency, state change clarity, and simplicity. \n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action customize\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?attribute - attribute_type ?value - value)\n    :precondition (and (selected ?entity) (modifiable ?attribute ?entity))\n    :effect (customized ?entity ?attribute ?value)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity`, `?attribute`, `?value`) to ensure the action can apply to a variety of tasks beyond just customizing character parts.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, from a selected entity and modifiable attribute to a customized attribute value.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by using abstract terms and combining similar logic into a single action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions (entity must be selected, attribute must be modifiable) and effects (attribute is customized) across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be applied to customize any attribute of any entity, whether it's a character, an item, or any other modifiable object in the domain."

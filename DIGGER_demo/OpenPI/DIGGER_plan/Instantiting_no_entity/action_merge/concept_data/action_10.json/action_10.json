    "To merge the given action sets into a single universal action named `swing`, we need to ensure that the action is general, captures state changes, and maintains logical consistency. Let's proceed by defining the universal `swing` action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action swing ; Swing an entity to change its state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?target - object)\n  :precondition (and (not (at ?entity ?target)) (ready ?entity))\n  :effect (and (at ?entity ?target) (not (ready ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity - object` and `?target - object`) to apply to a variety of tasks involving swinging an entity to a target state.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects describe a clear state change. The entity must not be at the target and must be in a ready state. The action results in the entity being at the target and no longer in a ready state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient. It avoids redundancy by merging similar actions and removing unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different contexts.\n\n### Application to Given Example:\n\n1. **Original Action**: `swing-leg-over-bike`\n   - **Parameters**: `?b - bike ?p - person`\n   - **Preconditions**: `(not (on-bike ?p)) (standing ?p)`\n   - **Effects**: `(on-bike ?p) (not (standing ?p))`\n\n2. **Merged Action**: `swing`\n   - **Parameters**: `?entity - object ?target - object`\n   - **Preconditions**: `(not (at ?entity ?target)) (ready ?entity)`\n   - **Effects**: `(at ?entity ?target) (not (ready ?entity))`\n\nBy using abstract parameters and maintaining the core logic, the merged action `swing` effectively combines the essence of the original actions while being adaptable to various tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal \"put\" action, we will follow the provided guidelines to create an abstract and adaptable action. We aim to ensure that the action is general, reflects state changes clearly, is simple, and maintains logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action put ; Place an item in a specific position or state\n  :parameters (?actor - person ?item - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (available ?actor) (not (at ?item ?location)))\n  :effect (at ?item ?location)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"put\" uses abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?item`, and `?location`) to apply to a wide variety of tasks involving placing or positioning an item.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the action can only be performed if the actor is available and the item is not already at the specified location. The effect updates the state to reflect that the item is now at the location.\n3. **Simplicity**: By focusing on the core logic of placing an item and updating its position, we avoid unnecessary complexity. This keeps the action simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis \"put\" action can now be adapted for various scenarios involving placing or positioning items, such as putting a foot on a pedal, placing a book on a shelf, or assigning an object to a specific location.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"hold\" that adheres to the provided guidelines, we need to ensure the following:\n\n1. **Generality:** The action should be adaptable to various tasks.\n2. **State Change:** Clearly defined preconditions and effects that describe the state change.\n3. **Simplicity:** Avoid redundancy and maintain simplicity.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** Maintain logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action hold ; Hold an entity and update the state accordingly\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?entity - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?agent) (not (holding ?agent ?entity)))\n  :effect (holding ?agent ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Generality:** The action \"hold\" is designed to be adaptable to various tasks by using the abstract parameters `?agent` and `?entity`.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the agent (`?agent`) must be available and not already holding the entity (`?entity`). The effect updates the state to reflect that the agent is now holding the entity.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by combining similar preconditions and effects into a single, clear action.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The logic is consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the action remains reasonable and applicable to various tasks.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in different scenarios where an agent needs to hold an entity, reflecting a state change that is simple, efficient, and logically consistent.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"pedal,\" we need to follow the guidelines provided. We should ensure the merged action is general, clearly describes state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pedal\n  ; Pedal a vehicle and alter its movement state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?v - vehicle)\n  :precondition (and (on ?p ?v) (foot-on-pedal ?p pedal-left) (foot-on-pedal ?p pedal-right) (holding-handlebars ?p ?v) (not (moving ?p ?v)))\n  :effect (and (moving ?p ?v) (not (stationary ?p ?v)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** The merged action is named \"pedal\" and is designed to be adaptable to various types of vehicles by using abstract parameters `?p` for the person and `?v` for the vehicle. This makes it applicable to any scenario involving pedaling a vehicle, not just a bike.\n\n2. **State Change:** The precondition specifies that the person must be on the vehicle, have their feet on the pedals, and hold the handlebars. The initial state is that the vehicle is not moving (`not (moving ?p ?v)`). The effect of the action is to change the state to the vehicle moving (`moving ?p ?v`) and no longer stationary (`not (stationary ?p ?v)`).\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The action merges the relevant conditions and effects without adding unnecessary complexity. It captures the essential steps needed for the \"pedal\" action to occur.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different tasks. The action ensures that all necessary conditions for pedaling are met and accurately reflects the state change resulting from the action.\n\nThis merged action follows the guidelines and effectively combines the provided actions into a single, versatile, and efficient PDDL action.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and example actions, the merged action \"stop\" should be designed to capture the general essence of stopping or halting a process or activity, applicable to multiple contexts. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action stop ; Stop an entity and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?activity - activity)\n  :precondition (and (engaged ?entity ?activity))\n  :effect (and (not (engaged ?entity ?activity)) (halted ?entity ?activity))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters `?entity` and `?activity` are abstract, making the action applicable to various tasks and entities, not just limited to a person and a bike.\n- **State Change**: The precondition checks if the entity is currently engaged in the activity. The effect updates the state to indicate that the entity is no longer engaged and is now halted.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by using general parameters and focusing on the core logic of stopping an activity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and logical, ensuring that the entity transitions from being engaged in an activity to being halted.\n\nThis merged action \"stop\" can be used in various contexts where an entity needs to cease an activity, maintaining the core logic and simplicity while being adaptable to different tasks."

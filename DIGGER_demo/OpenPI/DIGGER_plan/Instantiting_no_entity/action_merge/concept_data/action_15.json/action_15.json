    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named `prepare`, we need to abstract the parameters, ensure clear state change descriptions, remove redundancy, and maintain logical consistency. Here\u2019s how we can do it:\n\n### Merged Action: prepare\n\n```lisp\n(:action prepare ; Prepare an area or an entity for a task\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity - entity)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?entity) (not (prepared ?entity)))\n    :effect (prepared ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted to `?agent` and `?entity`, making the action adaptable to various scenarios involving preparation tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the entity's state from `not prepared` to `prepared`.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is concise, focusing only on the essential elements of preparation, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains a clear and reasonable logical structure, ensuring consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action `prepare` captures the essence of preparing an area or entity by an agent, making it applicable to a wide range of tasks while maintaining simplicity and logical coherence.",
    "Based on the provided example and the guidelines, the merged action for \"take\" should be general and adaptable to various tasks involving the acquisition or collection of items. Below is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action take ; Take an item from a source and update possession status\n  :parameters (?item - object ?source - entity ?agent - person)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?source) (not (in_possession ?agent ?item)) (is_part_of ?item ?source))\n  :effect (and (in_possession ?agent ?item) (not (is_part_of ?item ?source)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are kept abstract (`?item - object`, `?source - entity`, `?agent - person`) to apply to a variety of tasks beyond just taking a cutting from a rose bush.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions check if the agent is at the source location, does not already possess the item, and the item is part of the source.\n   - The effects update the possession status of the agent and remove the item from the source.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n   - The action is simple, focusing on the core logic of taking an item and updating the relevant states without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain logical coherence across different contexts where an agent takes an item from a source.\n\nBy adhering to these principles, the merged \"take\" action is versatile and can be applied to various scenarios involving possession and item transfer.",
    "(:action dip ; Dip an item into a substance\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?substance - object)\n    :precondition (and (has_item ?agent ?item) (at ?agent ?substance) (not (dipped ?item ?substance)))\n    :effect (dipped ?item ?substance))",
    "Given the action sets, the aim is to create a universal action \"plant\" that merges the logic and intent of planting a cutting into a generalized form. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action plant\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?location - location ?agent - person)\n    :precondition (and (has_entity ?agent ?entity) (prepared ?location) (at ?agent ?location) (ready_to_plant ?entity))\n    :effect (and (planted ?entity ?location) (not (has_entity ?agent ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?entity`, `?location`, and `?agent` to generalize the action for various entities (not just cuttings) and agents (not just players).\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change:\n    - Preconditions include the agent possessing the entity, the location being prepared, the agent being at the location, and the entity being ready to plant.\n    - The effect includes the entity being planted at the location and the agent no longer having the entity.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects and removing unnecessary complexity, ensuring the action is straightforward and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable for various planting scenarios.\n\nThis merged action \"plant\" can be adapted to a variety of tasks involving planting different entities at prepared locations by different agents."

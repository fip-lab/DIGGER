    "To merge the actions related to browning meat and onions, we need to generalize the parameters and ensure that the action can apply to various similar tasks. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action brown\n      :parameters (?npc - player ?item1 - item ?item2 - item ?tool - item ?location - location) \n      :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (inventory ?npc ?item1) (inventory ?npc ?item2) (inventory ?npc ?tool) (is_tool ?tool) (is_location ?location))\n      :effect (and (browned ?item1) (browned ?item2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n**Generality:** \nThe parameters have been generalized to `?item1` and `?item2` instead of specifying `?meat` and `?onion`. This allows the action to be used for browning any two items, not just meat and onion. The `?tool` parameter has been generalized from `?pan` to any tool, and `?location` has been generalized from `?stove` to any location.\n\n**State Change:**\nThe preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. If the `npc` is at the correct `location` and has the necessary items and tools, the items will be browned.\n\n**Simplicity:**\nBy merging the actions and generalizing the parameters, redundancy is avoided and the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n**Logical Consistency:**\nThe preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across various tasks, ensuring that the action is reasonable and applicable in different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can now be used to check and update the state of various items being browned in a variety of scenarios.",
    "Sure, let's merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action called \"drain\".\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```PDDL\n(:action drain ; Drain an excess substance from an item into a specified location\n  :parameters (?npc - entity ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (inventory ?npc ?item) (contains_excess ?item) (is_drain_location ?location))\n  :effect (not (contains_excess ?item))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted to apply to various tasks. `?npc` is an entity, `?item` is an object, and `?location` is a place, making it adaptable.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks if the entity is at the location, has the item, and the item contains excess substance, and if the location is suitable for draining. The effect removes the excess substance from the item.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar conditions and effects into a single, clear, and concise action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring consistency across different tasks where draining an excess substance is required.",
    "(:action add ; Add an item to a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?resource - object ?item - object) \n  :precondition (and (available ?npc) (contains ?resource ?item) (not (updated ?resource)))\n  :effect (and (updated ?resource))\n)",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, the merged action `finish` will be constructed as follows:\n\n**Objective**:\n- Generality: The action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n- State Change: Clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state.\n- Core Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects.\n- Avoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects.\n- Logical Consistency: Maintain reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\n**Action name after merge**: finish\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged**:\n- `brown_meat_and_onion`\n- `drain_excess_fat`\n- `add_ingredients_and_simmer`\n- `finish_taco_filling`\n\n**Explanation**:\n- Each step (browning meat and onion, draining excess fat, adding ingredients and simmering, and completing the taco filling) is part of a sequence to achieve the goal state of `finished ?taco_filling`.\n\n**Merged action**:\n```pddl\n(:action finish\n  ; Complete a multi-step task and update the status\n  :parameters (?npc - player ?location - location ?item - item ?task - task)\n  \n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?npc ?location) \n    (inventory ?npc ?item) \n    (task_step ?task ?step) ; Current step of the task\n    (valid_step ?step ?task) ; Validity of the current step in the task sequence\n  )\n  \n  :effect (and \n    (not (task_step ?task ?step)) ; Remove the current step\n    (next_step ?step ?next_step) ; Get the next step\n    (task_step ?task ?next_step) ; Update to the next step\n    (or\n      (and (is_final_step ?next_step) (finished ?task)) ; Check if it's the final step\n      (not (is_final_step ?next_step))\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?npc`, `?location`, `?item`, `?task`, `?step`, `?next_step`). This allows the action to be adaptable to various tasks involving multiple steps.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects describe the state changes required to progress through each step of the task.\n- **Core Logic**: The action retains the core logic of preconditions and effects, ensuring each step progresses logically.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is simplified to avoid redundancy by merging similar effects and ensuring efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring the task progresses through its steps until completion.\n\nThis merged action `finish` should be adaptable for various multi-step tasks, maintaining clarity and efficiency while ensuring logical progression towards the goal state."

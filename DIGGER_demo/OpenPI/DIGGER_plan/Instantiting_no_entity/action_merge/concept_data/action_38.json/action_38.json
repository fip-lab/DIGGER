    "Here's how we can merge the given actions into one universal action named `attempt`, following the provided guidelines:\n\n```pddl\n(:action attempt ; Attempt an action on a target with a weapon\n  :parameters (?actor - player ?target - player ?weapon - weapon ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?loc1) (at ?target ?loc2) (has_weapon ?actor ?weapon) (not (headshot ?actor ?target ?weapon)))\n  :effect (headshot ?actor ?target ?weapon)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Generality:** This action can be adapted to various scenarios where a player attempts to shoot another player using any weapon. The use of abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?target`, `?weapon`, `?loc1`, and `?loc2` makes the action applicable to a wide range of tasks.\n- **State Change:** The precondition ensures that the actor and target are at specified locations and that the actor possesses the weapon. The effect denotes that a headshot attempt has been made.\n- **Simplicity:** By merging similar conditions and effects, the action remains straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring that the logic remains consistent and applicable in different contexts.\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the essence of attempting a headshot with any weapon, making it a versatile and efficient representation of the original actions.",
    "(:action shotgun_shot ; Perform a shotgun shot, either at another player or oneself\n  :parameters (?p1 - player ?p2 - player)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p1 ?loc1) (has_weapon ?p1 shotgun) (at ?p2 ?loc2))\n  :effect (attempt_headshot ?p1 ?p2 shotgun)\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?p1 and ?p2) to generalize the action for shooting either another player or oneself.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions check that the player has a shotgun and is at a specific location, and the effect reflects the attempt to perform a headshot.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of checking the player's weapon and location, and the outcome of attempting a headshot, is maintained.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By combining the actions, redundancy is removed, as the same logic applies to both shooting oneself and another player.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent preconditions (availability of shotgun and locations) and effects (attempting a headshot) across different contexts.\n\nThe action remains simple, efficient, and adaptable to different scenarios involving the use of a shotgun.",
    "Given the guidelines and the provided actions, here's a merged action for the \"pistol\" tasks:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pistol ; Use the pistol in a player interaction\n :parameters (?p1 - player ?p2 - player ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location ?weapon - weapon)\n :precondition (and (at ?p1 ?loc1) (at ?p2 ?loc2) (has_weapon ?p1 ?weapon) (not (attempted ?p1 ?p2 ?weapon)))\n :effect (and (attempted ?p1 ?p2 ?weapon))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is named \"pistol\" to reflect its general use in player interactions involving a pistol.\n   - The parameters are abstracted to allow for a variety of tasks, such as different players (?p1, ?p2), locations (?loc1, ?loc2), and weapons (?weapon).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the players are at specific locations, and if player ?p1 has the weapon.\n   - The effect captures the state change of attempting an action involving the pistol.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the preconditions and effects into a single, clear action.\n   - Unnecessary complexity is removed, keeping the focus on the primary interaction (attempting a headshot).\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the action can only occur if the necessary conditions are met.\n   - The effect logically follows from the preconditions, ensuring consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action maintains the core logic of the original actions while being adaptable to various tasks involving a pistol.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"boomshot\", let's follow the guidelines to ensure generality, clear state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action boomshot\n  ; Perform a critical shot with a weapon, updating the shot status\n  :parameters (?w - weapon ?p - player ?target - player ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_weapon ?p ?w) (not (shot ?p ?target ?w)))\n  :effect (shot ?p ?target ?w)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?w - weapon`, `?p - player`, `?target - player`, `?loc - location`) which makes the action adaptable to various scenarios involving weapons and players.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks if the player is at the location and has the weapon, and ensures the shot has not been performed yet. The effect updates the status to indicate that the shot has been made.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining the similar effects of attempting a headshot into a single, clear shot status update.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear, maintaining the logical flow required for the action to be executed in different contexts.\n\nThis merged action ensures that the essential elements of the original actions are preserved while providing a more flexible and streamlined approach to handling similar tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"sniper,\" we should focus on the generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency outlined in the guidelines. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: sniper\n\n```pddl\n(:action sniper\n  ; Perform a sniper action, targeting an entity with a specified weapon\n  :parameters (?shooter - player ?target - player ?weapon - weapon ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?shooter ?loc1) (at ?target ?loc2) (has_weapon ?shooter ?weapon) (not (neutralized ?target)))\n  :effect (and (attempt_headshot ?shooter ?target ?weapon) (neutralized ?target))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The merged action \"sniper\" can be applied to a variety of tasks involving players, targets, and weapons. Abstract parameters such as `?shooter`, `?target`, `?weapon`, `?loc1`, and `?loc2` increase its applicability.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the shooter and target are at specified locations and that the shooter has a weapon. The effects include attempting a headshot and marking the target as neutralized.\n3. **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by merging the core logic of targeting and shooting, and it is simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the individual actions, ensuring adaptability, state transformation, and efficiency."

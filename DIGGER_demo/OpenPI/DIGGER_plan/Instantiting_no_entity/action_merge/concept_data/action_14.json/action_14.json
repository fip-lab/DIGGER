    "Based on the given guidelines and examples, the following merged action combines the \"choose\" actions into a single, universal action named `choose`. This action will be adaptable to various tasks, maintain clear state changes, and avoid redundancy while preserving logical consistency.\n\n```pddl\n(:action choose ;  Choose a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?resource - entity)\n  :precondition (and (available ?resource))\n  :effect (and (chosen ?entity ?resource) (not (available ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters have been abstracted to `?entity` and `?resource` to cover players, duels, stages, or any other objects. This makes the action adaptable to various tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks if the `?resource` is available. The effect marks the `?resource` as chosen and no longer available.\n3. **Core Logic**: The merged action retains the core logic of the individual actions, ensuring that a resource can be chosen and its status updated.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The action combines similar logic for choosing a duel, player, or stage into one action, avoiding repetition.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action should be applicable to a wide range of scenarios where a resource needs to be chosen and its availability status updated.",
    "To merge the given \"move\" actions into a single universal action while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract the parameters and ensure the preconditions and effects reflect the change in state. Here\u2019s the merged \"move\" action:\n\n### Merged Action\n```pddl\n(:action move\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?from - location ?to - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?from) (not (at ?agent ?to)))\n    :effect (and (at ?agent ?to) (not (at ?agent ?from)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?agent`, `?from`, `?to`), making the action adaptable to various tasks involving moving an entity from one location to another.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions check that the agent is at the `from` location and not at the `to` location. The effects update the state to reflect that the agent is now at the `to` location and no longer at the `from` location.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by focusing on the core logic of moving an entity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring that the action maintains consistent logic across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various scenarios where an agent needs to move from one location to another, making it a versatile and reusable PDDL action."

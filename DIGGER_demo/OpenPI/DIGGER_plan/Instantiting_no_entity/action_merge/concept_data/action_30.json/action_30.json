    "Here is the merged action based on the provided actions:\n\n### Objective: Boil\n### Merged Action: boil\n\n#### Action Sets to be Merged:\n1. **boil_water**\n    - **Parameters**: (?p - player ?l - location ?w - water)\n    - **Precondition**: (and (at ?p ?l) (has_stove ?l))\n    - **Effect**: (and (boiled ?w) (not (cold ?w)))\n\n#### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action boil\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?resource - resource ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (has_stove ?location))\n    :effect (and (boiled ?resource) (not (cold ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The parameters are abstracted to `?actor - entity`, `?resource - resource`, and `?location - location` to generalize the action for various contexts beyond just boiling water.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to depict the state change from cold to boiled for the resource.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - The action is simplified by merging similar effects and conditions, removing any unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic, ensuring the action is applicable across different tasks involving boiling.\n\nThe merged action `boil` is now adaptable and can be used for various tasks involving the boiling process, ensuring efficiency and simplicity.",
    "Based on the provided actions and the guidelines, we can merge the actions into a single universal \"add\" action that is general enough to apply to various tasks involving adding items and updating their states. Here\u2019s the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action add\n    :parameters (?p - player ?l - location ?item - object ?container - object ?condition - predicate)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (not (added ?item ?container)) ?condition)\n    :effect (and (added ?item ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters (`?item`, `?container`, and `?condition`) to represent the various objects and conditions involved in the original actions.\n   - This allows the action to adapt to different scenarios, such as adding macaroni to a pan, adding oil to a pan, etc.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are designed to reflect the state changes required by the original actions.\n   - The precondition checks if the item has not already been added and includes a flexible condition parameter (`?condition`) to accommodate different requirements (e.g., boiled water, drained macaroni).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant elements are removed, and the action is streamlined to handle multiple cases with a single set of parameters.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the necessary conditions are met before adding the item and updating its state accordingly.\n\nBy using this merged action, you can handle various tasks involving adding items and updating their states in a concise and efficient manner.",
    "Based on the given guidelines and the provided actions, here is the merged action for \"drain\":\n\n```lisp\n(:action drain\n  ; Drain a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?entity - resource)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (processed ?entity))\n  :effect (and (drained ?entity) (not (wet ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The parameters are made abstract (?actor, ?entity) to apply to a variety of tasks. This ensures that the action can be adapted to different contexts involving draining resources.\n- **State Change:** Preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, from being processed to drained and not wet.\n- **Simplicity:** The action is simplified by using abstract parameters and merging similar effects.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable in different contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"drain\" is adaptable to different scenarios where an agent needs to drain a resource and update its state.",
    "(:action cook ; Cook a food item using a specific tool and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?l - location ?item - object ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (prepared ?tool))\n  :effect (cooked ?item ?tool))",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named `serve`, we need to ensure that the resulting action maintains generality, clearly describes state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here is the merged `serve` action based on the provided guidelines and examples:\n\n```lisp\n(:action serve\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?location - location ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (cooked ?container))\n    :effect (served ?item ?container))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality:** The action `serve` is designed with abstract parameters `?npc`, `?item`, `?location`, and `?container` to apply to a variety of tasks. This increases its applicability beyond just serving macaroni.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions check if the person is at the specified location and if the container (e.g., a pan for macaroni) is cooked. The effect then updates the state to indicate that the item has been served using the container.\n3. **Simplicity:** By combining the parameters and effects, we avoid redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The logic behind the preconditions and effects remains consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the action can be adapted to various serving tasks.\n\nThis merged action is now a versatile and efficient representation of the `serve` task, applicable to multiple scenarios involving a person, an item, a location, and a container."

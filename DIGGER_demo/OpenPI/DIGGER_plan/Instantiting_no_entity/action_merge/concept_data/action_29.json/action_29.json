    "(:action build ;  Create or prepare something and update the state\n    :parameters (?p - player ?i - item ?l - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (not (built ?i ?l)))\n    :effect (and (built ?i ?l) (not (at ?p ?l)))\n)",
    "To create a single universal action from the given actions related to pouring and boxing chocolates, we need to generalize the parameters and effects while ensuring logical consistency and avoiding redundancy. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p kitchen) (at ?container kitchen) (not (in ?item ?container)))\n  :effect (and (in ?item ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action `pour` is generalized to handle any item being poured into a container, not limited to chocolate or boxes. The parameter names are abstracted to `?item` and `?container`, which can represent any object and any container respectively.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the player and the container are in the kitchen and that the item is not already in the container. The effect is that the item is now in the container.\n3. **Simplicity**: By merging similar actions, we avoid redundancy. The action is simple and efficient, focusing on the core logic of transferring an item into a container.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring the action can be applied to various tasks involving pouring or placing items into containers.\n\nThis merged action can be used in multiple scenarios where an item needs to be placed into a container, ensuring adaptability and simplicity.",
    "(:action freeze ;  Freeze an item to change its state from non-frozen to frozen\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?container - container ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (in_container ?item ?container) (at ?p ?location) (at ?container ?location))\n  :effect (and (frozen ?item) (not (melted ?item)))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters such as `?item` and `?container` to make it adaptable to various tasks that involve freezing items.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the transformation of the item's state from non-frozen (potentially melted) to frozen.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the core logic of freezing an item and ensuring the necessary conditions are met for the action to be performed.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and ensure that the action can be applied in different contexts where freezing an item is needed.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various scenarios involving freezing objects, provided the specified conditions are met.",
    "(:action cut ; Cut an object into a specific shape and update its state\n:parameters (?p - person ?o - object ?s - shape)\n:precondition (and (prepared ?o) (at ?p ?location) (has_tool ?p ?tool))\n:effect (and (shaped ?o ?s) (not (prepared ?o)))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters have been abstracted to allow for a variety of tasks. The player and the object can be any person and object, and the shape is an abstract parameter allowing different shapes to be specified. The location and tool are also abstract, making the action adaptable to different contexts.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The object must be in a \"prepared\" state (e.g., frozen for chocolate) and the person must have the necessary tool and be in the correct location. The effect is that the object is now in the specified shape and is no longer in the \"prepared\" state.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action has been simplified by removing specific references (e.g., heart shape, kitchen, heart cutter) and generalizing them.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain reasonable logic. The person must be in the correct location and have the necessary tool to cut the object, and the object must be in a state that allows it to be cut. The resulting state is that the object is in the specified shape and no longer in the prepared state."

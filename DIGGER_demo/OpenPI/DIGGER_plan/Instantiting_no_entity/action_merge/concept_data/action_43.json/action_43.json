    "(:action make ;  Make a connection or creation process for an item\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (not (connected ?actor ?item)) (has_item ?actor ?item))\n  :effect (connected ?actor ?item)\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"make\" is designed to apply to various creation or connection tasks by using abstract parameters (?actor - agent and ?item - object). This ensures the action is not limited to specific types of items or actors.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition requires that the item is not already connected and that the actor has the item. The effect changes the state to indicate that the item is now connected.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by removing unnecessary complexity and redundancy, focusing on the core logic of establishing a connection or creation.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring that the action maintains consistent logic across different tasks.",

    "Based on the provided actions and the guidelines, we can create a merged action that is generic enough to be applied to various tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating, while maintaining clarity and logical consistency. Below is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action check\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and (available ?actor) (not (checked ?actor ?resource)))\n    :effect (checked ?actor ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters have been abstracted to `?actor` and `?resource` to apply to various tasks. Here, `?actor` can represent any entity (e.g., person, player) and `?resource` can represent any resource (e.g., book, panel).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the actor is available and the resource has not been checked.\n   - The effect marks the resource as checked by the actor.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action is concise and avoids redundancy by combining the effects of checking various resources into a single action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are maintained logically, ensuring that the action can be applied consistently across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `check` can be used to check a variety of resources, simplifying the overall action set while maintaining clarity and functionality.",
    "Based on the provided examples of actions and the guidelines, we can merge the actions \"talk_using_microphone\" and \"advise_teammates\" into a single universal action named \"talk\". This merged action should be adaptable to various scenarios involving talking or advising using a microphone.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```\n(:action talk\n    :parameters (?p - player ?mic - microphone ?voice - voice ?advice - advice)\n    :precondition (and (microphone_connected ?p ?mic) \n                       (panel_checked ?p voice_panel) \n                       (not (talking ?p ?voice)) \n                       (not (advising ?p ?advice)))\n    :effect (and (talking ?p ?voice) \n                 (advising ?p ?advice))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action \"talk\" includes abstract parameters (?p - player, ?mic - microphone, ?voice - voice, ?advice - advice) that can be applied to various tasks involving talking or advising.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the microphone is connected and the relevant panel is checked before the player starts talking or advising. The effects reflect the state change where the player is now talking and advising.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundant actions have been merged, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring the player can only talk or advise if the microphone is connected and the panel is checked.\n\nThis merged action \"talk\" should cover scenarios where a player needs to talk using a microphone and provide advice to teammates, ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before these actions can proceed.",
    "Here is the merged action based on the provided guidelines:\n\nAction name after merge: use\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n```\n(:action use_microphone\n    :parameters (?p - player ?voice - voice)\n    :precondition (and (talking ?p ?voice) (not (using_microphone ?p ?voice)))\n    :effect (using_microphone ?p ?voice)\n)\n```\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n```\n(:action use ; Use a resource and update usage status\n:parameters (?user - agent ?resource - item)\n:precondition (and (available ?user) (not (using ?user ?resource)))\n:effect (using ?user ?resource))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `use` is designed to be general and adaptable to various contexts involving the use of resources by agents. The parameters are abstract (`?user` and `?resource`), which can represent any agent and any resource respectively.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the user is available and not already using the resource. The effect updates the state to indicate that the resource is now being used by the user.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters and combining similar effects into a single, straightforward action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by clearly defining preconditions and effects that make sense in different contexts of using a resource.\n\nOverall, the merged action `use` adheres to the guidelines provided and is designed to be efficient, simple, and generalizable for various tasks."

    "```pddl\n(:action place ; Place an item and update its status\n :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?target - location)\n :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?item) (at ?p ?target) (suitable ?target ?item))\n :effect (and (placed ?item ?target) (not (inventory ?p ?item)))\n)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The merged action `place` can represent a variety of tasks involving placing items in different locations. This can adapt to many contexts, such as placing ingredients in a blender, pouring into a glass, or garnishing a glass.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure the player has the item in their inventory and is at the target location, which is suitable for the item.\n   - The effect captures the state change by marking the item as placed at the target location and removing it from the player's inventory.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - By merging similar actions, the model avoids redundancy and maintains simplicity. The action does not include unnecessary complexity and focuses on the core logic of placing an item.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The merged action retains the core logic of preconditions and effects from the original actions, ensuring it remains consistent and reasonable across different tasks.\n\n### Original Actions Merged:\n\n1. **place_ingredients:**\n   - Parameters: (?p - player ?b - item ?s - item ?y - item ?bl - blender)\n   - Preconditions: (inventory ?p ?b) (inventory ?p ?s) (inventory ?p ?y) (is_blender ?bl) (empty ?bl)\n   - Effects: (in_blender ?bl ?b) (in_blender ?bl ?s) (in_blender ?bl ?y) (not (inventory ?p ?b)) (not (inventory ?p ?s)) (not (inventory ?p ?y))\n   - Merged into: (place ?p ?item ?bl)\n\n2. **pour_into_glass:**\n   - Parameters: (?p - player ?bl - blender ?g - glass)\n   - Preconditions: (at ?p ?g) (at ?p ?bl) (is_blender ?bl) (is_glass ?g) (blended_with_rum ?bl) (smooth_texture ?bl) (empty ?g)\n   - Effects: (filled ?g smoothie) (empty ?bl)\n   - Merged into: (place ?p ?bl ?g)\n\n3. **garnish_glass:**\n   - Parameters: (?p - player ?g - glass ?st - item)\n   - Preconditions: (inventory ?p ?st) (at ?p ?g) (is_glass ?g) (filled ?g smoothie)\n   - Effects: (garnished ?g ?st) (not (inventory ?p ?st))\n   - Merged into: (place ?p ?st ?g)\n\nBy merging these actions into the single universal action `place`, we achieve an abstract and adaptable action that can handle a variety of similar tasks efficiently.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action, we need to ensure that the action can handle various tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating. Below is the merged action, named `blend`, which captures the essence of the given actions while maintaining generality, clear state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\n```pddl\n(:action blend\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?bl - blender)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (at ?p ?bl)\n                    (is_blender ?bl)\n                    (or \n                        (and (in_blender ?bl bananas) (in_blender ?bl sorbet) (in_blender ?bl yogurt))\n                        (and (inventory ?p ?item1) (blended ?bl))\n                    )\n                  )\n    :effect (and \n                (or \n                    (and (blended ?bl) (smooth_texture ?bl))\n                    (and (in_blender ?bl ?item1) (not (inventory ?p ?item1)) (blended_with_rum ?bl))\n                )\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The parameters are abstract (`?p - player`, `?item1 - object`, `?item2 - object`, `?bl - blender`), making the action adaptable to various tasks.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects reflect clear state changes. The blending process either ensures the items are in the blender to create a smooth texture or adds an item from the player's inventory to the blended mixture.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and keeping the logic straightforward.\n- **Logical Consistency:** Preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, making sure the action remains logical and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the core logic of blending items and adding ingredients while ensuring that the action can be reused in different scenarios involving a blender."

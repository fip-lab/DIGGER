    "Here is the merged action based on the provided action sets:\n\n```pddl\n(:action scrub ; Scrub an item to clean it\n  :parameters (?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (is_empty ?item) (not (is_clean ?item)))\n  :effect (is_clean ?item)\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action adheres to the specified objectives and guidelines:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action is generalized to apply to any item that can be scrubbed clean, not just ketchup bottles.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, ensuring the item transitions from being dirty to clean.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by only including essential conditions.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts, ensuring logical consistency.",
    "(:action place ; Place an item in a specified location or setup\n    :parameters (?u - user ?item - object ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and (available ?u) (valid_location ?loc) (can_place ?item ?loc))\n    :effect (and (placed ?item ?loc) (not (available ?u)))\n)",
    "To merge the provided `replace` actions into a single universal action, we will follow the guidelines mentioned:\n\n1. **Generality**: Use abstract parameters that can adapt to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: Ensure preconditions and effects are clear and show the transformation of the entity's state.\n3. **Simplicity**: Avoid redundancy and maintain simplicity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Ensure logical consistency in preconditions and effects.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action replace\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?entity - object)\n    :precondition (and (requires_replacement ?entity) (not (replaced ?entity)))\n    :effect (and (replaced ?entity) (updated ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters `?actor` and `?entity` are abstract, allowing this action to be used in various contexts involving different agents and objects.\n- **State Change**: Preconditions indicate that the entity requires replacement and has not been replaced yet. Effects indicate that the entity is now replaced and updated.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on the core logic of replacing and updating an entity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are consistent and clear, ensuring the action can be applied to different tasks logically.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of replacing an entity and updating its status, making it adaptable to multiple scenarios.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we need to follow the guidelines and ensure the action is general, captures the state change, and remains simple and logically consistent. Here is the merged action named `finish`:\n\n```pddl\n(:action finish\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?task - task)\n  :precondition (and (task_completed ?entity ?task))\n  :effect (is_finished ?task)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `finish` uses abstract parameters `?entity` (representing any object or user) and `?task` (representing any task). This makes the action adaptable to various contexts and tasks.\n- **State Change**: The precondition `(task_completed ?entity ?task)` ensures that the task is marked as completed for the entity. The effect `(is_finished ?task)` indicates that the task is now finished.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundancy. It focuses solely on marking a task as finished once it is completed.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The precondition and effect are logically consistent and reasonable across different tasks, ensuring clarity and simplicity.\n\nThis merged action `finish` can be used in multiple contexts where the goal is to mark a task as finished upon its completion. It captures the essential state change and maintains a straightforward logic."

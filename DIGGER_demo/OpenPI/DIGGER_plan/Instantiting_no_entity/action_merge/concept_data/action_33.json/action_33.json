    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action called \"diffuse\" according to the specified guidelines, here's the resulting action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action diffuse ; Diffuse a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?context - context)\n  :precondition (and (has_context ?p ?context) (has_tool ?p ?tool) (not (diffused ?p ?item ?context)))\n  :effect (diffused ?p ?item ?context)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action is generalized by using abstract parameters like `?item` and `?context`, making it adaptable to various tasks beyond just diffusing light. \n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the change in state. The action transforms the state from not being diffused to being diffused.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple and efficient, removing unnecessary complexity. It avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts. The precondition checks if the person has the appropriate context and tool, and the effect updates the status to indicate that the item has been diffused in the given context.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various scenarios where a resource needs to be diffused and its status updated, making it a versatile and efficient action.",
    "Based on your requirements and provided examples, we will now merge the actions related to starting a task into a single universal action named `start`. This merged action will be designed to start various tasks, and will be adaptable to different scenarios by using abstract parameters.\n\nAction name after merge: start\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n1. `start_experimenting` - start experimenting with macro photography\n\n```PDDL\n(:action start_experimenting\n  :parameters (?p - person ?e - experiment)\n  :precondition (and (has_studio ?p ?s) (has_reflector ?p ?r) (has_closeup_lens ?p ?l) (has_diffused_light ?p ?l))\n  :effect (and (is_experimenting ?p ?e))\n)\n```\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n```PDDL\n(:action start ; Start a task or experiment\n  :parameters (?person - person ?task - task ?requirements - requirements)\n  :precondition (and (has_requirements ?person ?requirements))\n  :effect (and (is_started ?person ?task))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?person`, `?task`, and `?requirements` are abstract and adaptable to a variety of tasks, making the action applicable to multiple scenarios.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions check if the person has the necessary requirements, and the effect indicates that the task has started.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancies are avoided by using a single precondition to check if all necessary requirements are met.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains clear and reasonable logic across different tasks, ensuring the preconditions and effects are straightforward and consistent.\n\nThis merged action `start` can now be used for initiating various tasks as long as the person meets the necessary requirements, effectively capturing and transforming the entity's state as needed.",
    "(:action have ; Ensure the availability of necessary items\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?npc) (not (has ?npc ?item)))\n  :effect (has ?npc ?item))",
    "Based on the given example, we will define a merged action for \"closeup\" that can be used in various contexts, ensuring it is general, captures state changes, maintains simplicity, and is logically consistent. \n\nHere is the merged \"closeup\" action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action closeup ; Ensure a closeup resource is available for specific tasks\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (has_studio ?p ?s) (not (has_closeup ?p ?item)))\n  :effect (has_closeup ?p ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action `closeup` is designed with abstract parameters `?p` and `?item` to apply to multiple contexts where a closeup resource is required, such as a lens for photography or any specific tool/resource for other tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks if the person `?p` has a studio `?s` and does not already have the closeup resource `?item`. The effect updates the state to indicate that the person now has the closeup resource.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids unnecessary complexities by focusing on the core logic of checking and updating the availability of a closeup resource.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable within various contexts where a closeup resource might be needed, ensuring clear and logical state transitions.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in scenarios involving different tasks that require ensuring the availability of a closeup resource."

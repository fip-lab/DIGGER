    "Based on the provided tasks and the actions that need to be merged, here's a unified action called `clean` that encompasses all the given actions while maintaining generality, state change clarity, core logic, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean ; Clean an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?cleaner - object ?tool - object)\n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?actor ?item) \n    (inventory ?actor ?cleaner) \n    (or (and (cloth ?item) (at ?item storage) (at ?tool storage))\n        (and (window ?item) (or (clean ?tool) (scraped ?item)) (or (and (chemical_solvent ?cleaner) (at ?paint_splatters ?item))\n                                                                    (glass_cleaner ?cleaner)))\n        (and (paint_splatters ?item) (at ?item ?window)))\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (or (and (cloth ?item) (not (dirty ?item)) (not (dirty ?tool)))\n        (and (window ?item) (cleaned ?item) (not (dirty ?item)))\n        (and (paint_splatters ?item) (not (at ?item ?window)) (removed ?item)))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The action `clean` is designed to handle various cleaning tasks by abstracting parameters to `?actor`, `?item`, `cleaner`, and `tool`.\n    - `?actor` represents the agent performing the action.\n    - `?item` represents the object being cleaned (cloth, window, paint splatters).\n    - `?cleaner` represents the cleaning agent (water, glass cleaner, chemical solvent).\n    - `?tool` represents any additional tools needed (e.g., sponge, razor).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The preconditions and effects clearly reflect transformations:\n      - If cleaning a cloth, both the cloth and sponge must be in storage.\n      - If cleaning a window, the window must be at the location, and appropriate cleaning materials/tools must be available.\n      - If removing paint splatters, the splatters must be on the window, and the cleaner must be a chemical solvent.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n    - Retains the core logic of preconditions and effects:\n      - Ensures the agent is at the correct location.\n      - Checks for necessary inventory items.\n      - Applies appropriate effects for each scenario: cleaning cloth, cleaning window, or removing paint splatters.\n\n4. **Simplicity**:\n    - Avoids redundancy by merging similar effects and using abstract parameters.\n    - Simplifies conditions by combining them using logical `or` and `and` operators.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - Maintains consistency across different tasks:\n      - Preconditions are specific to the type of item being cleaned.\n      - Effects appropriately update the state of the item being cleaned.",
    "Here is the merged PDDL action based on the given guidelines:\n\n### Action name after merge: wet\n\n#### Action sets that need to be merged:\n```\n(:action wet_window_with_water\n  :parameters (?p - player ?w - window ?water - water)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?w) (has_water ?water))\n  :effect (and (wet ?w) (not (dry ?w)))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```\n(:action wet ; Wet a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?resource - entity ?liquid - entity)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?resource) (has_liquid ?liquid))\n  :effect (and (wet ?resource) (not (dry ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters such as `?agent`, `?resource`, and `?liquid` to ensure that it is adaptable to a variety of tasks, not just specific to `player`, `window`, and `water`.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in the state of the `resource`, transforming it from `dry` to `wet`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity by combining similar effects into a single coherent action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects that are consistent across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of contexts where an entity needs to wet a resource using some liquid, reflecting a generalized approach to the given tasks.",
    "Based on the guidelines and the provided examples, here is the merged action for the \"position\" task:\n\n```pddl\n(:action position ; Position an item and update the state of the target\n  :parameters (?p - player ?r - object ?w - target)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?w) (inventory ?p ?r))\n  :effect (and (positioned ?r ?w) (scraped ?w) (not (painted ?w)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters (?r - object, ?w - target) to increase applicability to different scenarios.\n   - The action name \"position\" is kept general to encompass a variety of tasks involving positioning an item and updating the state of the target.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the player is at the target location and has the item in their inventory.\n   - Effects describe the state change: the item is positioned at the target, and specific state changes to the target (e.g., scraped, not painted) are applied.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects and ensuring the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring the action can be applied in varied scenarios.\n\nThis merged action captures the essential elements of positioning an item and updating the state of the target while adhering to the guidelines provided."

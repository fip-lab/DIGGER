    "The merged action should combine the common elements of the provided actions, focusing on the concept of \"placing\" or \"pouring\" ingredients or items, and ensuring that the parameters are abstract enough to apply to a variety of similar tasks. Here\u2019s the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action place\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (has ?actor ?item) (at ?item ?location) (not (placed ?item ?location)))\n  :effect (placed ?item ?location)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?actor`, `?item`, and `?location` are abstract enough to cover a variety of tasks involving placing or pouring different types of items.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The precondition checks if the actor has the item and the item is at the location, but not yet placed. The effect marks the item as placed at the location.\n3. **Simplicity**: This merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into a single, more abstract action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable to multiple scenarios involving placing or pouring items, making it a versatile addition to your PDDL action set.",
    "(:action remove ; Remove an item from a location and update its status\n:parameters (?item - object ?location - place)\n:precondition (and (in ?item ?location) (not (removed ?item ?location)))\n:effect (and (removed ?item ?location))\n)",
    "To create a universal action named \"press\" that combines the provided action sets while adhering to the guidelines, we need to abstract the parameters and maintain the core logic of preconditions and effects. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action press\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?surface - object)\n    :precondition (and (contains ?holder ?entity) (at ?holder ?surface) (not (pressed ?entity)))\n    :effect (pressed ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n**Generality:** \n- The parameters have been abstracted to `?entity - object` and `?surface - object`, making them adaptable to various tasks involving pressing an entity onto a surface.\n- The holder (e.g., `?bowl` in the original action) is generalized to `?holder` to increase applicability.\n\n**State Change:**\n- Preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change: an entity contained in a holder and located at a surface is pressed, altering its state to `pressed`.\n\n**Core Logic:**\n- The core logic (preconditions and effects) is retained without unnecessary complexity, ensuring the action remains logical and straightforward.\n\n**Avoid Redundancy:**\n- Actions with similar effects are merged by abstracting parameters, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n\n**Logical Consistency:**\n- The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, maintaining clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can be applied to various scenarios where an entity needs to be pressed onto a surface, reflecting a clear state change from being unpressed to pressed.",
    "(:action create ; Create a new entity or status based on specific conditions\n:parameters (?creator - agent ?item - resource ?location - place)\n:precondition (and (available ?creator) (at ?item ?location) (not (created ?item)))\n:effect (created ?item))"

    "The merged action should be designed to encompass the essential elements of folding and transforming resources. Here\u2019s how the actions can be combined into a single universal action that captures the core logic and maintains simplicity and flexibility:\n\n```pddl\n(:action fold\n    ; Fold a resource and update task status\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?loc - location ?input - object ?output - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?loc) (inventory ?npc ?input) (foldable ?input ?output))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?npc ?output) (not (inventory ?npc ?input)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action `fold` can apply to various tasks by using abstract parameters `?input` and `?output`, making it adaptable to different folding scenarios.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state: an item is transformed from `?input` to `?output`, reflecting the folding process.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects, ensuring it remains simple and efficient. The conditions necessary for folding are captured in the abstract `foldable` predicate.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable in various contexts.\n\nBy using abstract parameters and a general `foldable` predicate, the merged action can be easily adapted to different tasks involving folding and creating new items.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"cut,\" we will follow the provided guidelines to ensure generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action cut ; Cut an item and update inventory status\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?cut_piece - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?loc) (inventory ?npc ?item) (measured_to_cut ?item))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?npc ?cut_piece) (not (inventory ?npc ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters (?npc, ?item, ?cut_piece, ?loc) to increase applicability across various tasks involving cutting and updating inventory status.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the NPC is at the location, has the item in their inventory, and the item is measured to be cut. The effects update the inventory by adding the cut piece and removing the original item.\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is kept simple by avoiding unnecessary complexity and merging only the essential elements required for the task.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains a consistent logic, ensuring the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear for different contexts.\n\nThis universal \"cut\" action can now be applied to a variety of tasks that involve cutting items and updating inventory statuses, adhering to the guidelines provided.",
    "To merge the provided PDDL action into a single universal action named \"tape,\" we need to ensure that the merged action is adaptable to a variety of tasks, clearly describes the state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency.\n\nGiven the provided action to be merged, the merged action would look like this:\n\n```PDDL\n(:action tape ; Tape an item and update the state\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item1 - object ?item2 - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?loc) (inventory ?npc ?item1) (ready_for_taping ?item1))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?npc ?item2) (not (inventory ?npc ?item1)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?npc`, `?item1`, `?item2`) to adapt to a variety of tasks.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes (e.g., an item is in inventory and ready for taping, and after the action, the item is transformed).\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions (checking the location and inventory) and effects (updating inventory) is retained.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is simplified by removing unnecessary complexity, focusing on the essential state changes.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action is designed to be flexible and applicable to tasks involving taping or transforming items, capturing the necessary state changes, and maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.",
    "Sure, let's follow the guidelines and combine the given PDDL actions into a single universal action that generalizes the \"put\" action. This merged action will be adaptable to various tasks involving placing items into a designated location or machine.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action put\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?loc - location ?item - object ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?loc) (inventory ?npc ?item) (at ?container ?loc))\n    :effect (and (in ?item ?container) (not (inventory ?npc ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract enough to cover a variety of tasks, using `?item` to represent any object and `?container` to represent any target location or machine.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the NPC is at the correct location and has the item in their inventory, and that the container (or machine) is also at that location. The effects update the state to reflect that the item is now inside the container and no longer in the NPC's inventory.\n3. **Simplicity**: Any unnecessary complexity is avoided by merging similar actions and their effects into a single action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and logical, ensuring that they apply to different contexts where an item needs to be placed into a container.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need more examples or further customization!"

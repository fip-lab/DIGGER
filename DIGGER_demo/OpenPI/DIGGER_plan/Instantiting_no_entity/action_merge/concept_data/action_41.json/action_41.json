    "Given the provided example and the guidelines, we will merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"read\" that captures the essence of the individual actions while maintaining generality, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nOriginal Actions:\n1. `(:action read_instructions :parameters (?ins - instructions ?p - person) :precondition (and (at ?ins ?p)) :effect (and (read ?ins)))`\n\nMerged Action:\n```\n(:action read ; Read a resource and update status\n :parameters (?entity - entity ?resource - resource)\n :precondition (and (at ?resource ?entity) (not (read ?resource)))\n :effect (read ?resource))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: We use abstract parameters `?entity` and `?resource` to make the action adaptable to various tasks. This allows the action to apply to any entity reading any resource, not limited to specific types.\n- **State Change**: The precondition ensures that the entity is at the location of the resource and that the resource has not been read yet. The effect updates the state to indicate that the resource has been read.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is concise and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action fulfills the guidelines by being general, clearly reflecting state changes, avoiding redundancy, and maintaining logical consistency.",
    "(:action wash ;  Wash an item of clothing and update its cleanliness status\n  :parameters (?item - clothing ?p - person ?wm - washing_machine)\n  :precondition (and (read ?ins) (at ?item ?p) (at ?wm ?p))\n  :effect (clean ?item)\n)",
    "Given the action sets that need to be merged, we will create a more generalized and adaptable \"check\" action. Here\u2019s how we can merge them:\n\n### Original Actions:\n1. **check_boots**\n```pddl\n(:action check_boots\n  :parameters (?b - boots ?p - person)\n  :precondition (and (at ?b ?p) (is_synthetic ?b))\n  :effect (and (checked ?b))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\nThe merged action will be a general \"check\" action that can be applied to various entities and states. We will use abstract parameters to increase applicability, clearly define the state changes, and remove any redundancy.\n\n### Final Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action check ; Check an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - entity ?checker - person)\n  :precondition (and (available ?checker) (at ?entity ?checker) (not (checked ?entity)) (condition ?entity))\n  :effect (and (checked ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?entity` and `?checker` are abstract enough to represent any item and person, respectively.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(not (checked ?entity))` ensures that the item is not already checked. The effect `(checked ?entity)` marks the item as checked.\n3. **Core Logic**: The general logic of checking an item and updating its status remains intact.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The action merges similar effects into a single, efficient action without unnecessary complexity.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring the item must meet the condition before it can be checked.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving checking different entities and updating their states.",
    "To merge the given cleaning actions into a single universal action, we need to abstract the parameters and generalize the preconditions and effects while ensuring simplicity and logical consistency. Below is the merged action named \"clean\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean ; Clean an item and update its state\n  :parameters (?person - person ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?item ?person) (not (clean ?item)))\n  :effect (clean ?item)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The parameters `?person` and `?item` are abstract enough to be applicable to a variety of cleaning tasks.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the person is at the item's location and the item is not already clean. The effect is that the item becomes clean.\n- **Simplicity:** The merged action is straightforward, focusing on the essential conditions and effects needed to clean any item.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain logical consistency across different tasks involving cleaning.\n\nThis merged action can now be used for any task that involves cleaning an item, making it adaptable and efficient in various contexts."

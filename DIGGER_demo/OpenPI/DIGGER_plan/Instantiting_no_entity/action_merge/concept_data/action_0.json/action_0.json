    "```pddl\n(:action plug ;  Plug various devices into each other to establish connections\n  :parameters (?device1 - object ?device2 - object ?location - location)\n  \n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?device1 ?location) \n    (at ?device2 ?location) \n    (or\n      (and (has_hdmi_input ?device2) (is_hdmi_converter ?device1))\n      (and (is_hdmi_converter ?device2) (is_hdmi_cable ?device1))\n      (and (has_av_composite_output ?device2) (is_hdmi_converter ?device1))\n      (and (connected ?device1 ?device2) (has_hdmi_input ?device2) (is_hdmi_converter ?device1))\n    )\n    (not (connected ?device1 ?device2))\n  )\n  \n  :effect (connected ?device1 ?device2)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Merged Action:\n\n**Action Name: `plug`**\n\n**Parameters**:\n- `?device1` - A generic object representing the first device.\n- `?device2` - A generic object representing the second device.\n- `?location` - The location where the devices need to be present to be connected.\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Both `?device1` and `?device2` must be at the same `?location`.\n- The action is applicable in multiple contexts represented by the following conditions:\n  - `?device2` has an HDMI input and `?device1` is an HDMI converter.\n  - `?device2` is an HDMI converter and `?device1` is an HDMI cable.\n  - `?device2` has an AV Composite Output and `?device1` is an HDMI converter.\n  - `?device1` and `?device2` are already connected, `?device2` has an HDMI input, and `?device1` is an HDMI converter.\n- The devices must not be already connected.\n\n**Effect**:\n- The effect of the action is that `?device1` and `?device2` become connected.\n\n### Summary:\nThis merged action `plug` is designed to handle various types of plugging activities. It abstracts the specific devices into more generic parameters (`?device1` and `?device2`) and covers multiple scenarios (HDMI converter to TV, HDMI cable to converter, HDMI converter to Wii, HDMI cable to TV) within a single action. The preconditions and effects ensure the logical consistency and state changes necessary for connecting the devices."

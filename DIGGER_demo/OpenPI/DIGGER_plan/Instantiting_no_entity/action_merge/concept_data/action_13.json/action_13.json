    "Here is the merged action for the \"find\" actions based on the given guidelines:\n\n```lisp\n(:action find\n  ; Find and acquire an item or entity, updating the player's inventory\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?p ?item) (not (at ?item ?loc)))\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action is designed to be general and adaptable to various tasks of finding and acquiring different items or entities. It maintains the core logic of the preconditions and effects, ensuring simplicity and avoiding redundancy while being logically consistent across different contexts.\n\nThe combined action \"find\" can now be utilized to handle various scenarios like catching a Vulpix, finding a Fire Stone, or finding an Ice Stone, provided that the item is present at the specified location and the player is at that location.",
    "The actions after the merger are:\n\n```lisp\n(:action use\n  :parameters (?p - player ?v - pokemon ?stone - evolution_stone)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?v) (inventory ?p ?stone) (bag_selected ?p ?bag))\n  :effect (and (evolved ?v) (not (inventory ?p ?stone)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `use` is designed to apply to any player (`?p`), any type of Pok\u00e9mon (`?v`), and any type of evolutionary stone (`?stone`). This increases the applicability of the action to a variety of tasks involving different Pok\u00e9mon and evolutionary stones.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the player has both the Pok\u00e9mon and the stone in their inventory, and the bag is selected. The effect ensures that the Pok\u00e9mon evolves and the stone is no longer in the inventory.\n3. **Simplicity**: By merging the `use_fire_stone` and `use_ice_stone` actions, we avoid redundancy and simplify the logic, as both actions have similar effects.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.",
    "(:action wait ; Wait for an event or state change\n:parameters (?agent - entity ?object - entity)\n:precondition (and (evolved ?object))\n:effect (event_occurred ?object))"

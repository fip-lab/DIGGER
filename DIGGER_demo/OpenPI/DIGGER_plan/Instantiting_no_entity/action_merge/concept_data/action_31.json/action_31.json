    "Based on the provided guidelines and example actions, here is the merged action for \"train\":\n\n```lisp\n(:action train ; Train an entity to enhance its capabilities\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?entity - object)\n    :precondition (and (has ?npc ?entity) (not (trained ?entity)))\n    :effect (trained ?entity)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?npc` and `?entity` are kept abstract to apply to various tasks, such as training different types of entities (e.g., Pokemon, skills, etc.). This ensures that the action is not limited to a specific type of training.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(not (trained ?entity))` ensures that the entity is only trained if it hasn't been trained before. The effect `(trained ?entity)` clearly reflects the state change, indicating that the entity has been trained.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is streamlined to focus on the core logic of training, removing unnecessary complexity and ensuring efficiency.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logical and consistent across different contexts where training might be applicable.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving training different entities while maintaining clarity and simplicity.",
    "Below is the merged PDDL action named \"evolve\" that combines the given actions into a single, universal action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action evolve ; Evolve an entity to its next state\n:parameters (?npc - npc ?entity - entity ?next_state - entity ?item - object)\n:precondition (and (has ?npc ?entity) (or (trained ?entity) (inventory ?npc ?item)) (not (evolved ?entity)))\n:effect (and (has ?npc ?next_state) (not (has ?npc ?entity)) (evolved ?entity) (when (inventory ?npc ?item) (not (inventory ?npc ?item))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters are defined abstractly to apply to various tasks, where `?npc` is a non-player character, `?entity` is the current state of the entity, `?next_state` is the evolved state of the entity, and `?item` is any object that might be required for the evolution.\n   \n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the `?npc` has the `?entity`, and either the entity is trained or the `?npc` has the required item in their inventory.\n   - The effects reflect that the `?npc` will now have the `?next_state` (evolved state) and will no longer have the `?entity` (pre-evolved state). If an item was used for the evolution, it will be removed from the `?npc`'s inventory.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundancies are avoided by combining similar effects and ensuring the action is general enough to cover both scenarios of evolving with training or with an item, without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts, ensuring that evolution only happens when the necessary conditions are met (either trained or having the item) and reflecting the resulting state changes clearly.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable for a variety of evolution or state transformation tasks within a PDDL framework.",
    "Based on the given guidelines and the provided example actions, here is the merged action for the \"copy\" task:\n\n### Merged Action: `copy`\n\n```lisp\n(:action copy ; Copy an item to an entity's inventory\n  :parameters (?npc - npc ?loc - location ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?loc) (has_item ?loc ?item))\n  :effect (inventory ?npc ?item))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters `?npc`, `?loc`, and `?item` to ensure it can be applied to various tasks involving copying items to an entity's inventory. \n   - `?npc` represents any non-player character (npc).\n   - `?loc` represents any location.\n   - `?item` represents any object.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the change in state. \n   - The precondition `(has_item ?loc ?item)` ensures that the item is available at the specified location.\n   - The effect `(inventory ?npc ?item)` indicates that the item has been added to the npc's inventory.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - Redundant conditions or effects are removed. The original action had a duplicated effect `(inventory ?npc ?rare_candy)`, which was simplified to a single instance.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The merged action maintains logical consistency by ensuring the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear.\n   - The preconditions ensure that the npc is at the location where the item exists, and the effect simply adds the item to the npc's inventory.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged `copy` action is generalized, simple, and logically consistent, making it adaptable to various tasks involving the copying of items to an entity's inventory.",

    "To create the merged action named `find`, we'll apply the guidelines to ensure the action is general, captures state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here's the consolidated action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action find\n  ; Find a resource or location and update player status\n  :parameters (?p - player ?target - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (not (found ?p ?target)))\n  :effect (and (found ?p ?target))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action is renamed to `find` to reflect a general search or discovery task. Abstract parameters `?p` (player), `?target` (object to be found), and `?loc` (location) are used to ensure the action can apply to various contexts.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks the player\u2019s current location and ensures the target has not been found yet. The effect updates the state to indicate the target has been found.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on the essential elements of finding something.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are straightforward and reasonable, ensuring consistent logic across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action efficiently combines the logic of finding an area or resource, updating the player's status accordingly.",
    "Based on the guidelines provided and the given example actions, here is the merged action for \"collect\" that maintains generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n**Action name after merge: collect**\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n\n1. `(:action collect_sticks\n      :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location ?stick - stick)\n      :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_twigs_and_sticks ?loc))\n      :effect (and (inventory ?p ?stick))\n)`\n\n**The actions after the merger are:**\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect ; Collect an item from a location and update inventory\n  :parameters (?collector - agent ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?collector ?location) (available ?item ?location))\n  :effect (and (in_inventory ?collector ?item))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters like `?collector`, `?item`, and `?location` to make it adaptable to various tasks involving collection.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change from having an item available at a location to having the item in the collector's inventory.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding any unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions ensure that the collector is at the specified location and that the item is available at that location. The effect updates the state to reflect that the item is now in the collector's inventory.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"collect\" can be applied to a wide range of tasks involving the collection of items, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "Given the provided actions and the guidelines for merging them, the merged action should generalize the notion of creating various objects or structures. Here's a consolidated action that captures the essence of all given actions:\n\n```\n(:action create\n  ; Create an object or structure using required materials at a specified location\n  :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location ?material - object ?creation - creation)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (has_material ?p ?material ?loc))\n  :effect (and (at ?creation ?loc) (not (has_material ?p ?material ?loc)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is named `create`, which generally applies to various creation tasks.\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?material` and `?creation`, making it adaptable to different creation scenarios.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the player is at the location and has the required material.\n   - The effect reflects the creation of an object or structure at the location and the consumption of the material.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant details from individual actions are removed, combining similar effects into one coherent action.\n   - The action is kept simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining consistency across different tasks.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `create` can now be used for a variety of creation tasks, such as creating formations, decorations, and building walls, using the required materials at specific locations.",
    "(:action use ;  Use an item to perform a task and update status\n:parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?location - location ?target - target)\n:precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (at ?target ?location) (inventory ?agent ?item))\n:effect (and (at ?target_with_item ?location) (not (inventory ?agent ?item))))"

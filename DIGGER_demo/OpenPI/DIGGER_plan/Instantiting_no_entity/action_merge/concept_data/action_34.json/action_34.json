    "Here is the merged action for the provided tasks:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean\n    ; Clean an item and update its status\n    :parameters (?item - object ?user - person)\n    :precondition (and (dirty ?item) (available ?user))\n    :effect (and (clean ?item) (not (dirty ?item)))\n)\n\n(:action wear\n    ; Wear an item if it's clean and update its status\n    :parameters (?item - object ?user - person)\n    :precondition (and (clean ?item) (not (damaged ?item)) (person ?user))\n    :effect (and (wearing ?user ?item) (not (clean ?item)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?item` and `?user` have been abstracted to `object` and `person` respectively, making these actions adaptable to a variety of tasks involving cleaning and wearing items.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes, such as transitioning an item from dirty to clean, and from clean to being worn.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged actions are simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by clearly distinguishing between cleaning and wearing actions.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness in various contexts.\n\nBy merging the actions in this way, we ensure that they are adaptable, clear, and efficient for a variety of scenarios involving cleaning and wearing items.",
    "Given the guidelines and examples, the merged action for the \"use\" scenario should be designed to be general and adaptable, capturing the essence of using an item for a specific purpose with appropriate state changes. Here's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action use ; Use an item for a specific purpose\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?purpose - purpose)\n    :precondition (and (available ?npc) (not (used_for ?item ?purpose)) (suitable_for ?item ?purpose))\n    :effect (and (used_for ?item ?purpose) (not (suitable_for ?item ?purpose)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"use\" applies to using any item for any suitable purpose, not limited to specific types of items or purposes.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the change in state from an item being suitable for a purpose to being used for that purpose.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action removes redundant parameters and conditions, focusing on the core logic.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring that the item must be suitable for the purpose before it can be used.\n\nThis merged action can be applied to various tasks where an item is used for a particular purpose, making it adaptable and efficient.",
    "(:action make ; Create or transform an item using a tool\n    :parameters (?user - entity ?tool - object ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (available ?user) (usable ?tool) (quality ?item))\n    :effect (and (created ?user ?item) (not (quality ?item)))\n)",
    "(:action donate ; Donate a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object)\n  :precondition (and (clean ?entity) (not (damaged ?entity)))\n  :effect (and (donated ?entity) (not (clean ?entity)))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses the abstract parameter ?entity to allow for donating various objects, not just underpants.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the entity is clean and not damaged before it can be donated. The effects reflect the change in state, marking the entity as donated and no longer clean.\n3. **Simplicity**: Unnecessary complexity is removed, focusing on the core logic needed for the donation process.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring the logic is clear and applicable to different contexts involving clean, undamaged objects ready for donation."

    "Given the requirements for merging the actions `get_gems` and `buy_stuff` into a single universal action named `get`, here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action get ; Obtain an item and update the player's inventory\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p market) (or (inventory ?p ?resource) (not (inventory ?p ?item))))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?p ?item) (not (inventory ?p ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action `get` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks, such as obtaining items or resources. The parameters `?p`, `?item`, and `?resource` are abstract, allowing the action to be used in different contexts.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The player `?p` must be at the `market` and must either already have the `?resource` or not yet have the `?item`. The effect is that the player will have the `?item` and will no longer have the `?resource` (if applicable).\n- **Simplicity**: The action merges the logic of obtaining an item and updating the inventory without unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring the action can be applied in various scenarios where a player obtains items or resources.",
    "To merge the given actions (`build_rooms`, `create_rooms`, and `make_area`) into a single universal action named `build`, we need to create an action that is general enough to handle the creation of rooms and areas, while maintaining clear preconditions and effects for state changes. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action build\n    :parameters (?p - player ?entity - object ?l - location)\n    :precondition \n        (and \n            (at ?p ?l)\n            (or \n                (and (inventory ?p ?entity) (not (built ?entity ?l)))\n                (and (built ?entity ?l) (not (room_created ?entity ?l)))\n            )\n        )\n    :effect \n        (and \n            (or \n                (built ?entity ?l)\n                (room_created ?entity ?l)\n                (area_created ?entity ?l)\n            )\n        )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?entity` to represent either a room or an area, making it adaptable to different tasks.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are designed to reflect the change in state. If the entity is in the player's inventory and not built yet, it will be built. If it is already built, it will be marked as created (either room or area).\n- **Simplicity**: By combining similar actions, redundancy is avoided and the action remains simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are designed to be clear and consistent, ensuring that the merged action logically follows in different contexts. The use of `or` ensures that the appropriate state changes are applied based on the current state of the entity.",
    "Based on the given actions and objectives, the merged action for \"keep\" should be:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Generality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Use abstract parameters to increase applicability.\n- State Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\n- Simplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\n- Logical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nAction name after merge: keep\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n- keep_family_safe\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n```lisp\n(:action keep\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?target - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?entity ?location) (at ?target ?location))\n    :effect (safe ?target)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- Generality: The merged action \"keep\" uses abstract parameters (?entity - object, ?target - object, ?location - location) to be adaptable to various tasks.\n- State Change: The preconditions (at ?entity ?location) and (at ?target ?location) ensure that both the entity and the target are at the specified location before the action can be performed. The effect (safe ?target) indicates that the target becomes safe as a result of the action.\n- Simplicity: The merged action is simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by combining similar effects into a single action.\n- Logical Consistency: The action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts, ensuring logical consistency.\n\nThis merged action \"keep\" can be adapted to various tasks that involve ensuring the safety or protection of a target entity at a specific location, maintaining simplicity and logical consistency."

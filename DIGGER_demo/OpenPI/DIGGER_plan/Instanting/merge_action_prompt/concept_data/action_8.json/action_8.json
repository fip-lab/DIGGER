The precondition checks if the game is unplayed, and the effect marks the game as played.\n- **select_character**: This action represents selecting a character. The precondition checks if the character is unselected, and the effect marks the character as selected.\n- **save_name_and_exit**: This action represents naming the character and exiting the character creation mode. The precondition checks if the character is selected and nameless, and the effect marks the character as named.\n- **turn_on_free_game**: This action represents turning on the free play mode. The precondition checks if the game is played, and the effect turns on the free play mode.\n\nThese actions capture the intent and logic of the steps provided in the task description for creating a character in Lego Star Wars.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

    "\nYou're a professional AI, and you're able to combine multiple PDDL actions into one universal action. The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:plug\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action plug_in_converter_tv\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?tv - tv)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?tv) (not (connected ?tv)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?tv) (power ?tv)))\n\n\n(:action plug_into_converter_tv\n    :parameters (?tv - tv ?hdmi - hdmi_cable)\n    :precondition (and (at ?tv) (has_hdmi_port ?tv) (not (connected ?hdmi ?tv)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?tv)))\n\n\n(:action plug_in_converter_wii\n    :parameters (?wii - wii ?converter - converter)\n    :precondition (and (at ?wii) (has_av_output ?wii) (not (connected ?wii ?converter)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?wii ?converter)))\n\n\n(:action plug_hdmi_to_converter_and_tv\n    :parameters (?converter - converter ?hdmi - hdmi_cable ?tv - tv)\n    :precondition (and (at ?converter) (at ?tv) (has_hdmi_port ?converter) (has_hdmi_port ?tv) (not (connected ?hdmi ?converter)) (not (connected ?hdmi ?tv)))\n    :effect (and (connected ?hdmi ?converter) (connected ?hdmi ?tv)))\n```\n\nExplanation of PDDL actions:\n1. `plug_in_converter_tv`: This action represents plugging in the converter to the TV by the NPC. The precondition checks if the NPC is at the TV and the TV is not connected. The effect is that the TV becomes connected and powered.\n2. `plug_into_converter_tv`: This action represents plugging the HDMI cable into the TV. The precondition checks if the TV has an HDMI port and the HDMI cable is not connected to the TV. The effect is that the HDMI cable is connected to the TV.\n3. `plug_in_converter_wii`: This action represents plugging the converter into the Wii. The precondition checks if the Wii has an AV output and the converter is not connected to the Wii. The effect is that the Wii is connected to the converter.\n4. `plug_hdmi_to_converter_and_tv`: This action represents plugging the HDMI cable into both the converter and the TV. The precondition checks if the converter and TV have HDMI ports and the HDMI cable is not connected to either. The effect is that the HDMI cable is connected to both the converter and the TV.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

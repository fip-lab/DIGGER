    "Based on the provided example and guidelines, the merged action for the \"cut\" actions can be designed to be general, capturing the essence of modifying an entity's state while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency. Here is a generalized and merged version of the \"cut\" action:\n\n```\n(:action cut ; Cut an item to transform its state\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?new_item - object)\n  :precondition (and (inventory ?npc ?item) (not (inventory ?npc ?new_item)))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?npc ?new_item) (not (inventory ?npc ?item)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality:** The parameters `?npc - person`, `?item - object`, and `?new_item - object` are abstract enough to cover a wide range of tasks involving cutting or transforming items.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly demonstrate the transformation of one item into another, ensuring the entity's state is updated correctly.\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core logic of state transformation.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable, ensuring that the action can be applied in various contexts involving modification or creation through cutting.\n\nThis merged action maintains the core logic of the original actions, providing a simple and efficient way to handle tasks involving cutting or transforming items in different scenarios.",
    "Here is the merged PDDL action \"squeeze\" that combines the actions related to handling lemons:\n\n```pddl\n(:action squeeze ; General action for squeezing or using lemons on objects\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?item - object ?location - location ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and \n        (inventory ?npc ?item) \n        (or \n            (and (at ?npc ?location) (type ?item lemon_half))\n            (and (type ?item lemon) (not (inventory ?npc ?resource)))\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or \n            (and (type ?item lemon) (inventory ?npc ?resource) (not (inventory ?npc ?item)))\n            (and (at ?npc ?location) (clean ?location) (not (inventory ?npc ?item)))\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters such as `?item` (object) and `?resource` (resource) to ensure it can adapt to multiple tasks involving lemons and their uses.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - If the `?item` is a lemon and `?resource` (juice) is not yet in the inventory, squeezing the lemon results in having the juice in the inventory and no longer having the lemon.\n   - If the `?item` is a lemon half and the `?npc` is at a `?location` (e.g., faucet), using the lemon half results in the location being clean and no longer having the lemon half.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The action retains the core logic of preconditions and effects:\n   - Checking inventory and item types (lemon or lemon_half).\n   - Updating inventory and the state of the location (clean or not).\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action removes redundancy by combining similar effects:\n   - Using the lemon results in obtaining juice.\n   - Using the lemon half results in cleaning the location.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains logical consistency by clearly defining preconditions related to item types and effects applicable to different contexts:\n   - When dealing with whole lemons and juice.\n   - When dealing with lemon halves and cleaning specific locations.\n\nThis merged action streamlines the process of handling lemons, accommodating various tasks such as squeezing for juice or cleaning an object, while ensuring simplicity and efficient state transformations."

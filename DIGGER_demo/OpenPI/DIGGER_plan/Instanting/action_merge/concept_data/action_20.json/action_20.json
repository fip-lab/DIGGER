    "(:action gather ; Gather resources from a location and add them to inventory\n:parameters (?p - person ?loc - location ?item - object)\n:precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?item ?loc))\n:effect (inventory ?p ?item))",
    "Given the guidelines and the example provided, let's merge the given action set for the \"push\" action into a single, universal action.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action push ; Push an object to a designated position\n  :parameters (?actor - entity ?obj - object ?target - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?target) (inventory ?actor ?obj) (shape ?target circular))\n  :effect (squares_position ?obj away_from_ends))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters `?actor`, `?obj`, and `?target` to ensure applicability to a variety of tasks involving different entities, objects, and locations.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change involved in pushing the object to a designated position.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy and ensures simplicity by focusing on core preconditions and effects.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic, ensuring that preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable in different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action can be applied to various tasks involving pushing objects to specific locations, thus achieving the objective of creating a universal and adaptable action.",
    "(:action slide ; Slide a movable object within a defined space\n:parameters (?agent - entity ?object - movable ?space - area ?pos - position)\n:precondition (and (at ?agent ?pos) (at ?object ?pos) (object_position ?object initial_state))\n:effect (object_position ?object final_state))",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action that adheres to the specified guidelines, we can create a general `finish` action. This action will encapsulate the state changes described in the individual actions while maintaining simplicity, logical consistency, and avoiding redundancy. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action finish ; Finalize a task by updating the status of an entity\n    :parameters (?p - person ?entity - object ?status_from - status ?status_to - status ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (status ?entity ?status_from))\n    :effect (and (status ?entity ?status_to) (not (status ?entity ?status_from)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action `finish` is designed to be general and adaptable to various tasks. It uses abstract parameters (`?p`, `?entity`, `?status_from`, `?status_to`, `?loc`) to ensure broad applicability.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state\u2014transitioning the status of an entity from one state (`?status_from`) to another (`?status_to`).\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on the core logic of changing an entity's status, which is a common requirement across many tasks.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic. It checks if the person is at the specified location and if the entity has the initial status before applying the status change.\n\nThis universal `finish` action can be used in contexts similar to the provided examples, like finalizing the wreath by updating its status or other tasks involving status updates of entities.",

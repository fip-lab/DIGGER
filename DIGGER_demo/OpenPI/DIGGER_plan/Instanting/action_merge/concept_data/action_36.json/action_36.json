    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal action named \"place,\" we'll aim to maintain generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action place ; Place an item into a container and update its location status\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?actor ?item) (inventory ?actor ?container) (not (in ?item ?container)))\n    :effect (and (in ?item ?container) (not (on_surface ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action is designed to be applicable to any scenario where an item needs to be placed into a container, not limited to specific items like \"cookies\" or \"biscuits.\"\n   - Abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?item`, and `?container` ensure that this action can be adapted to various contexts.\n\n2. **State Change:** \n   - The `precondition` ensures that the `?actor` has both the `?item` and the `?container` in their inventory, and the `?item` is not already inside the `?container`.\n   - The `effect` reflects the state change where the `?item` is now within the `?container` and is no longer on any surface.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** \n   - Redundant specifics about the item being on a plate or tray are generalized to `on_surface`, simplifying the representation without losing essential logic.\n   - The action combines similar effects into a single, efficient representation.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** \n   - The preconditions and effects maintain a logical flow, ensuring the action makes sense across different contexts where placing an item is required.\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the essence of placing an item into a container while being adaptable to various situations.",
    "(:action separate ; Separate an item using a specified method\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?method - method)\n  :precondition (and (in ?item ?container) (inventory ?p ?method))\n  :effect (and (separated ?item) (prepared ?container))\n)",
    "To merge the provided actions for the objective of \"freezing\" and \"thawing\" into a single universal action that can be adapted to various tasks while maintaining generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can create a more abstract action. This action will encompass the transformation of states in a generalized manner, accommodating both freezing and thawing functionalities.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```\n(:action freeze_or_thaw\n  ; General action to either freeze or thaw an item\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?state - state ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (in ?item ?container) (separated ?item) (lined ?container) (or (and (in_freezer ?item) (frozen ?item) (equals ?state thawed)) (and (not (in_freezer ?item)) (not (frozen ?item)) (equals ?state frozen))))\n  :effect (and (when (equals ?state frozen)\n                  (and (in_freezer ?item) (frozen ?item) (not (pliable ?item)) (hard ?item))\n                )\n                (when (equals ?state thawed)\n                  (and (not (in_freezer ?item)) (thawed ?item) (chewy ?item) (soft ?item))\n                )\n        )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action `freeze_or_thaw` is designed to handle both freezing and thawing processes by using the `?state` parameter, which can be either `frozen` or `thawed`.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the state transformations for both freezing and thawing.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining the logical conditions within the same action, ensuring the action remains simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain clear and reasonable logic across different contexts, ensuring the merged action's consistency.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of tasks involving state changes between frozen and thawed conditions, providing a versatile and adaptable solution."

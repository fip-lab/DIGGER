    "To merge the actions into a single universal PDDL action named \"read,\" which applies to multiple tasks involving reading and comprehending different types of resources, we need to follow the given guidelines:\n\n**Generality**: Use abstract parameters that can represent a variety of resources that might be read or comprehended.\n\n**State Change**: Clearly indicate the transformation in the state from unread to read and comprehended.\n\n**Simplicity**: Avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\n**Logical Consistency**: Maintain reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nHere's how the merged action \"read\" could be defined:\n\n```pddl\n(:action read ; Read a resource and comprehend its contents\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - readable)\n    :precondition (and (available ?actor) (unread ?resource))\n    :effect (and (read ?resource) (comprehended ?actor ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name**: The action is named \"read\" to represent the act of reading and comprehending any resource.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `?actor - agent`: Represents any entity capable of reading or comprehending.\n  - `?resource - readable`: Represents any type of resource that can be read, such as instructions, books, or documents.\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(available ?actor)`: The actor must be available to perform the reading task.\n  - `(unread ?resource)`: The resource must be in an unread state to be eligible for reading.\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(read ?resource)`: The resource's state changes from unread to read.\n  - `(comprehended ?actor ?resource)`: The actor has comprehended the contents of the resource, reflecting a deeper understanding beyond just reading.\n\nThis merged action \"read\" is designed to be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving reading and understanding different resources, ensuring clarity and efficiency.",
    "Given the tasks and descriptions provided, we'll merge the actions `wash_gore_Tex` and `wash_polar_fleece` into a single universal action called `wash`. This merged action will capture the essential steps, preconditions, and effects while ensuring generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action wash ; Wash an item of clothing using appropriate instructions or washing machine\n    :parameters (?clothing - clothing ?wm - washing_machine ?instr - instructions)\n    :precondition (and (dirty ?clothing)\n                       (or (and (read ?instr) (known ?instr))\n                           (empty ?wm)))\n    :effect (and (clean ?clothing)\n                 (not (dirty ?clothing))\n                 (when (empty ?wm)\n                       (and (full_with ?wm ?clothing) (on ?wm))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name**: The action is named `wash` to be general and applicable to different types of clothing.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?clothing` - Represents the item of clothing.\n  - `?wm` - Represents the washing machine.\n  - `?instr` - Represents the washing instructions.\n- **Preconditions**: \n  - The clothing must be dirty (`dirty ?clothing`).\n  - Either:\n    - The washing instructions must be read and known (`read ?instr` and `known ?instr`), or\n    - The washing machine must be empty (`empty ?wm`).\n- **Effects**:\n  - The clothing becomes clean (`clean ?clothing`).\n  - The clothing is no longer dirty (`not (dirty ?clothing)`).\n  - If using a washing machine:\n    - The washing machine becomes full with the clothing (`full_with ?wm ?clothing`).\n    - The washing machine is turned on (`on ?wm`).\n\nThis merged action maintains the core logic, avoids redundancy, and is simple and efficient. It is adaptable to different washing scenarios, ensuring logical consistency across various tasks.",
    "To create a merged action that adheres to the guidelines and objectives provided, we need to ensure that the merged action is general, simple, logically consistent, and clearly describes state changes. Here's how the merged action, named `check`, would look after considering the provided actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action check ; General action for checking an item and updating its status\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (available ?agent) (not (checked ?agent ?item)))\n    :effect (and (checked ?agent ?item))\n)\n\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality:** The merged action is designed to be flexible, using abstract parameters `?agent` and `?item` that can represent any person or object, respectively. This allows the action to be applicable to a wide range of tasks beyond just books or boots.\n\n2. **State Change:** The precondition ensures that the agent is available and has not already checked the item. The effect marks the item as checked by the agent, clearly transforming the entity's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:** The action is streamlined to focus on the core logic of checking an item. Any redundant conditions or specificities (such as checking for synthetic material in boots) are removed for simplicity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts by focusing on the abstract concept of an agent checking an item. This ensures a consistent logic that can be adapted to various scenarios.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action `check` is versatile, efficient, and logically sound, capable of being applied to various tasks involving checking and updating the status of an item.",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and example, the merged action for the \"clean\" task should be adaptable to various cleaning scenarios involving different entities and items. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean ; Clean an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (worn ?item ?npc) (dirty ?item))\n  :effect (and (clean ?item) (not (dirty ?item)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality:** The action is designed to be applicable to any entity (`?npc`) and any item (`?item`), making it versatile for various cleaning tasks.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions require that the item is worn by the entity and is dirty. The effects change the state of the item to clean and remove the dirty status.\n3. **Core Logic:** The action retains the core logic of requiring the item to be dirty before it can be cleaned.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:** The action merges the cleaning logic into a single, efficient action without unnecessary complexity.\n5. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action should fulfill the requirements of simplicity, generality, and logical consistency."

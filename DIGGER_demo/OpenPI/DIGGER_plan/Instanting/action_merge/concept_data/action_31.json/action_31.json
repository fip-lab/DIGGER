    "To create a merged action named \"train\" that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, we'll generalize the parameters and ensure the action can apply to different entities and contexts. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action train ; Train an entity and update its status\n  :parameters (?trainer - agent ?entity - trainable)\n  :precondition (and (agent ?trainer) (untrained ?entity))\n  :effect (and (trained ?entity) (not (untrained ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are generalized to `?trainer - agent` and `?entity - trainable` to allow the action to be applied to various agents and trainable entities, not just NPCs and Wailmers.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(untrained ?entity)` requires the entity to be in an untrained state.\n   - The effect `(trained ?entity)` signifies the entity has been trained, and `(not (untrained ?entity))` ensures the entity is no longer in the untrained state.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The core logic of requiring an agent to perform the training and switching the state from untrained to trained is retained.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - The action is kept simple by focusing only on the essential state changes necessary for training.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency across different tasks by using abstract parameters and clear preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action can be applied to any situation that involves training an entity, provided the entities involved are defined in the domain as `agent` and `trainable`.",
    "```pddl\n(:action evolve ; Evolve an entity with necessary conditions and resources\n  :parameters (?npc - npc ?entity - object ?resource - resource_type)\n  :precondition (and (npc ?npc) (unevolved ?entity) (or (trained ?entity) (has_resource ?entity ?resource)))\n  :effect (and (evolved ?entity) (not (unevolved ?entity)) (when (has_resource ?entity ?resource) (not (has_resource ?entity ?resource))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?resource` to allow adaptation to different tasks beyond just evolving a `wailmer`. The `resource_type` parameter is generalized to accommodate different types of resources needed for evolution.\n\n- **State Change:** The precondition includes either being `trained` or having the necessary `resource`, reflecting the conditions necessary for evolution. The effect clearly shows the transition from `unevolved` to `evolved`, removing the `resource` if it's used.\n\n- **Simplicity:** Similar logic and effects from the original actions are merged, ensuring the action remains straightforward without redundancy.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** Preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts of evolving an entity, maintaining clarity and reasonableness.",
    "To follow the guidelines and merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"copy,\" we need to ensure that the action is general, captures state changes clearly, maintains core logic, avoids redundancy, and retains logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action copy ; Copy a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - entity ?resource - resource)\n  :precondition (and (not (copied ?resource)))\n  :effect (and (copied ?resource) (has_resource ?entity ?resource))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity` and `?resource`) to allow the action to be adaptable to various tasks, avoiding specificity to particular entities or resources.\n- **State Change**: The precondition checks that the resource has not been copied yet. The effect marks the resource as copied and assigns it to the entity, clearly reflecting the state change.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects. The action is kept simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts, ensuring clarity and consistency.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various scenarios where copying a resource and updating its status is necessary.",
    "Here is the merged action for the \"evolution\" action sets:\n\n```lisp\n(:action evolution ; Evolve an entity and update its state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?state_pre - state ?state_post - state)\n  :precondition (and (entity ?entity) (in_state ?entity ?state_pre))\n  :effect (and (in_state ?entity ?state_post) (not (in_state ?entity ?state_pre)))\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action named \"evolution\" captures the essence of evolving an entity from a pre-evolution state to a post-evolution state. It is abstract enough to be applicable to various tasks that involve state transformation, ensuring generality. The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change, progressively transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached. The action is simple, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency across different contexts."

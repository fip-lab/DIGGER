    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, I've merged the actions related to cleaning, wearing, and donating underpants. Here is the merged action called \"clean\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action manage_underpants\n  :parameters (?u - underpants ?c - person)\n  :precondition (and \n    (or (dirty ?u) (clean ?u) (wearing ?c ?u) (available ?c))\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (when (dirty ?u) (and (clean ?u) (not (dirty ?u)))) ; Clean underpants\n    (when (clean ?u) (and (wearing ?c ?u) (not (clean ?u)))) ; Wear underpants\n    (when (wearing ?c ?u) (and (donated ?u) (not (wearing ?c ?u)))) ; Donate underpants\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The merged action `manage_underpants` uses abstract parameters `?u` for underpants and `?c` for person, making it adaptable to a variety of tasks involving underpants.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action captures the state changes from dirty to clean, clean to worn, and worn to donated, progressively transforming the entity's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and ensuring that the core logic is retained without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are maintained in a logical sequence, ensuring reasonable transitions between states.\n\nThis merged action should be applicable to various tasks involving the checking, modifying, or creating states of underpants, while maintaining clarity and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"use,\" we follow the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. The merged action should be adaptable to various tasks involving the use of underpants, considering their state and intended use. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action use ; Use an item for a specific purpose and update its state\n  :parameters (?u - underpants ?purpose - usage)\n  :precondition (and (clean ?u) (appropriate ?purpose ?u))\n  :effect (and (used_for ?u ?purpose) (not (clean ?u)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"use,\" making it broadly applicable to various tasks.\n   - The parameter `?purpose` is introduced to capture different usages such as \"garden ties,\" \"stuffing,\" or \"wearing,\" making it adaptable to multiple contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(clean ?u)` ensures that the item is in a usable state.\n   - The effect `(used_for ?u ?purpose)` captures the use of the item, and `(not (clean ?u))` reflects the state change after use.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - By merging similar actions, redundancy is avoided, resulting in a concise and efficient representation.\n   - The parameter `?purpose` simplifies the representation by consolidating different use cases.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The precondition `(appropriate ?purpose ?u)` ensures that the item is suitable for the intended purpose.\n   - The logic remains consistent across different contexts, ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action is versatile and can be expanded with additional use cases by defining what constitutes \"appropriate\" for different purposes, maintaining logical consistency and adaptability.",
    "(:action make\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object ?tool - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?actor) (available ?tool) (not (processed ?resource)))\n  :effect (and (processed ?resource) (used ?tool))\n)",
    "Based on the provided guidelines and the given example, we will merge the actions for `donate` by ensuring generality, clear state changes, and avoiding redundancy. Here is the merged action:\n\n```\n(:action donate ;  Donate an item and update its status\n:parameters (?donor - agent ?item - object)\n:precondition (and (clean ?item) (possessed ?donor ?item))\n:effect (and (donated ?item) (not (clean ?item)) (not (possessed ?donor ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is named `donate` to reflect a general donation process.\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?donor - agent` and `?item - object`, making the action applicable to various tasks involving different types of items and donors.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition checks if the `item` is `clean` and `possessed` by the `donor`.\n   - The effect states that the `item` is now `donated`, it is no longer `clean`, and it is no longer `possessed` by the `donor`.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action is kept simple by focusing on the key state changes without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The logical consistency is maintained by ensuring the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable in various contexts. The `donate` action will work for any `agent` donating any `object`, provided it meets the preconditions.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving the donation of items while ensuring clarity and simplicity."

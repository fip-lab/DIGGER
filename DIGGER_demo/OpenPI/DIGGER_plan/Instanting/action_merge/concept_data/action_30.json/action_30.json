    "To create a merged action that generalizes the concept of \"cook\" while adhering to the given guidelines, we need to combine the provided action into a more abstract form. Here's how we can achieve that:\n\n### Merged Action: cook\n\n```pddl\n(:action cook\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?location - place)\n  :precondition (at ?actor ?location)\n  :effect (and (engaged_in_activity ?actor cooking)\n                (state ?location messy))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - **Parameters**: The parameters are abstractly defined as `?actor` and `?location` to represent any agent performing the action in any location. This makes the action adaptable to various contexts beyond just \"player\" and \"kitchen.\"\n   - **Activity**: The specific activity \"cooking\" is generalized to an agent being \"engaged_in_activity,\" allowing this framework to be extended to any activity if needed.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Precondition**: The precondition remains simple with the agent needing to be at the specified location to perform the action.\n   - **Effect**: The effects specify that the agent becomes engaged in the activity, and the location becomes messy, reflecting a change in the state of both the agent and the environment.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - The action is defined with minimal complexity, focusing only on necessary preconditions and effects.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The logic is consistent, with clear preconditions and effects that are reasonable and applicable in a variety of scenarios where an agent performs an activity at a location.\n\nThis structure provides a framework for extending the \"cook\" action to multiple scenarios where an agent performs tasks in various environments, maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.",
    "Based on the guidelines provided and the example actions, we can merge the actions related to boiling into a single universal action. This action will maintain generality, reflect state changes, and avoid redundancy. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action boiled\n  :parameters (?item - object ?state - state ?new_state - state)\n  :precondition (and (at ?item ?state) (not (at ?item ?new_state)))\n  :effect (and (at ?item ?new_state) (not (at ?item ?state)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `boiled` uses abstract parameters `?item`, `?state`, and `?new_state` to apply to a variety of tasks. This makes it adaptable beyond just boiling water or cooking macaroni.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state from `?state` to `?new_state`, ensuring that the entity's state is progressively transformed.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters and a generalized structure.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain clear and reasonable logic, ensuring the action can be applied consistently across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `boiled` is now a versatile and efficient representation that can be used in various scenarios involving state changes.",
    "To create a universal \"stirfry\" action from the provided set of actions, we need to abstract and generalize the parameters, conditions, and effects, ensuring that the merged action logically represents a broader cooking process without unnecessary redundancy. Here's a proposal for the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action stirfry\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?k - kitchen)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?npc ?k) \n        (cooking ?npc ?k) \n        (has_ingredient ?npc oil) \n        (has_ingredient ?npc sauce) \n        (has_ingredient ?npc macaroni)\n        (boiled ?npc macaroni))\n    :effect (and \n        (cooked ?npc stirfry) \n        (not (cooking ?npc ?k)) \n        (kitchen_messy ?k))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action \"stirfry\" is designed to be adaptable to different cooking scenarios that involve an NPC preparing a stirfry dish in a kitchen. We use abstract parameters like `?npc` for the person and `?k` for the kitchen to maintain generality.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - **Preconditions**: \n     - The NPC must be present at the kitchen (`at ?npc ?k`).\n     - The NPC is in the process of cooking (`cooking ?npc ?k`).\n     - The NPC has the necessary ingredients: oil, sauce, and boiled macaroni (`has_ingredient ?npc oil`, `has_ingredient ?npc sauce`, `has_ingredient ?npc macaroni`).\n     - The macaroni is already boiled (`boiled ?npc macaroni`).\n   - **Effects**: \n     - A stirfry dish is cooked by the NPC (`cooked ?npc stirfry`).\n     - The cooking process in the kitchen concludes (`not (cooking ?npc ?k)`).\n     - The kitchen becomes messy due to the cooking process (`kitchen_messy ?k`).\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoidance of Redundancy**: By merging the actions related to boiling, adding oil and sauce, and stir-frying into one cohesive action, we avoid redundancy and unnecessary complexity. The key steps of preparing a stirfry dish are encapsulated within this single action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistency by ensuring that all necessary preconditions are met before the stirfry can be considered cooked, and it clearly defines the resulting state changes.\n\nThis merged action should serve as a versatile and efficient representation of the cooking task within a PDDL domain, applicable to various scenarios that involve preparing a stirfry dish."

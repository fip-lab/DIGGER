    "Here's the merged action for the task \"find,\" following the guidelines provided:\n\nMerged Action: find\n\n```lisp\n(:action find\n  ; Find an appropriate resource and update its selection status\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?resource - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (not (selected ?resource)) (condition_met ?resource))\n  :effect (selected ?resource)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?agent`, `?resource`, and `?location`) to be adaptable to various contexts.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly outline the state transformation, where a resource that meets certain conditions and is at a specific location is selected.\n- **Core Logic**: The action retains the core logic of finding and selecting a suitable resource while keeping it simple.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action removes unnecessary complexities and merges actions with similar effects.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain reasonable and consistent logic across different tasks.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action named \"collect\" that encapsulates the essence of the provided action, we need to ensure that it is general, reflects a clear state change, and is logically consistent. Here\u2019s how the merged action could be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect ; Collect an item and update its status in the player's inventory\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?loc - location ?item - collectible)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?loc) (collectible ?item) (not (in_inventory ?agent ?item)))\n    :effect (and (in_inventory ?agent ?item) (collected ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Breakdown:\n\n- **Generality**: The action is named \"collect\" to be applicable to any collection task. The parameters are abstracted to `?agent` and `?item` to generalize across different types of entities and objects.\n\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the `?agent` is at the correct `?loc` and that `?item` is in a collectible state. The effects transition the `?item` into the `?agent`'s inventory and mark it as `collected`, reflecting a clear change of state.\n\n- **Core Logic**: The precondition `(not (in_inventory ?agent ?item))` prevents redundancy by ensuring the same item isn't collected multiple times without necessity.\n\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is simplified to focus on the core logic of collection, minimizing unnecessary complexity while maintaining essential conditions and effects.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action remains consistent across various contexts where an agent needs to collect an item, ensuring the logic for collection is clear and reasonable.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action named `create`, we need to maintain generality, clear state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action create ; Create an entity by transforming available resources\n    :parameters (?p - player ?loc - location ?resource - object ?product - entity)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (inventory ?p ?resource))\n    :effect (and (created ?product ?resource) (not (inventory ?p ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is named `create`, reflecting its use in various creation tasks.\n   - Parameters are abstracted to `?resource` and `?product`, which can represent any object and entity being created, whether it's a formation, decoration, etc.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the player is at the specified location and has the required resource in their inventory.\n   - Effects describe the transformation of the resource into a new product and the removal of the resource from the inventory.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action encapsulates the core logic of both `create_formation` and `create_decorations` without redundancy.\n   - The use of abstract entities (`?resource` and `?product`) ensures that the action remains simple yet applicable to a variety of tasks.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, ensuring that any player with the required resource can create the desired product at a specified location.\n   - This action can be adapted to new tasks by specifying different `?resource` and `?product` pairs.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged `create` action is versatile and efficient, capable of handling a range of creation tasks within the PDDL framework.",
    "To create a merged action named \"use\" that generalizes the functionality of using different resources in various contexts, let's follow the guidelines provided:\n\n1. **Generality**: Use abstract parameters to adapt to multiple tasks.\n2. **State Change**: Clearly describe the state change through preconditions and effects.\n3. **Simplicity**: Avoid redundancy.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Maintain reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action use ; Use a resource to modify an entity's state\n  :parameters (?user - agent ?resource - object ?target - entity ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?user ?location) (not (used ?user ?resource ?target)) (has_resource ?user ?resource))\n  :effect (and (used ?user ?resource ?target) (not (has_resource ?user ?resource)) (modified ?target ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters `?user`, `?resource`, `?target`, and `?location` are abstract enough to apply to various contexts.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the `?user` is at the `?location`, hasn't already used the `?resource` on the `?target`, and has the `?resource`.\n   - Effects describe the `?resource` being used on the `?target`, the `?user` no longer having the `?resource`, and the `?target` being modified by the `?resource`.\n   \n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions are removed, and the action is simplified to core logic.\n   \n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Maintains reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts, ensuring that the logic remains clear and applicable.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n- **Covering a structure with leaves**:\n  - Parameters: `?user = player1`, `?resource = leaves`, `?target = wall1`, `?location = location1`\n  - Preconditions: `(at player1 location1)`, `(not (used player1 leaves wall1))`, `(has_resource player1 leaves)`\n  - Effects: `(used player1 leaves wall1)`, `(not (has_resource player1 leaves))`, `(modified wall1 leaves)`\n\nThis generalized action \"use\" can now be adapted to various tasks involving the use of resources to modify entities' states, following the principles of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency."

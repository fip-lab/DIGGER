    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal `choose` action, we need to ensure the merged action can handle general tasks involving choosing and updating the state accordingly. The goal is to maintain generality and simplicity while ensuring logical consistency. Here\u2019s how we can design the merged `choose` action based on the provided guidelines:\n\n### Actions to be Merged\n1. **choose_boat**\n```pddl\n(:action choose_boat\n    :parameters (?passenger - passenger ?boat - boat)\n    :precondition (and (at ?passenger near_boat) (not (in ?passenger ?boat)))\n    :effect (and (chosen ?passenger ?boat) (not (at ?passenger near_boat)))\n)\n```\n\n2. **hold_rails**\n```pddl\n(:action hold_rails\n    :parameters (?passenger - passenger ?boat - boat)\n    :precondition (and (chosen ?passenger ?boat) (not (holding_rails ?passenger ?boat)))\n    :effect (holding_rails ?passenger ?boat)\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action: `choose`\n\n```pddl\n(:action choose ; Choose an item and update the state accordingly\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and (in_context ?agent ?context) (not (chosen ?agent ?item)))\n    :effect (and (chosen ?agent ?item) (updated_context ?agent ?context))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?item`, `?context`) to increase adaptability to various tasks, avoiding specificity to a single type of action.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the change in state from not chosen to chosen, and an update to the context.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects into a single action, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic applicable across different contexts and tasks.\n\n### Application\nThis merged `choose` action can be applied to different scenarios involving an agent selecting an item and updating the state accordingly. Here are a few examples of how this action can be adapted:\n\n1. **Choosing a Boat**\n```pddl\n(:action choose_boat\n    :parameters (?passenger - passenger ?boat - boat ?context - boat_context)\n    :precondition (and (in_context ?passenger ?context) (not (chosen ?passenger ?boat)))\n    :effect (and (chosen ?passenger ?boat) (updated_context ?passenger ?context))\n)\n```\n\n2. **Holding Rails**\n```pddl\n(:action hold_rails\n    :parameters (?passenger - passenger ?boat - boat ?context - boat_context)\n    :precondition (and (chosen ?passenger ?boat) (not (holding_rails ?passenger ?boat)))\n    :effect (holding_rails ?passenger ?boat)\n)\n```\n\nBy following this approach, we ensure that the merged action remains adaptable, simple, and logically consistent for various tasks involving choosing and updating states.",
    "To merge the PDDL actions under the new action name \"hold,\" we need to create a universal action that applies to various tasks involving holding or stabilizing. The merged action should be general and adaptable, clearly describe the state changes, and maintain logical consistency.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action hold\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (chosen ?entity ?item) (at ?entity near_item))\n    :effect (holding ?entity ?item)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?item` to apply to a variety of tasks. This avoids being limited to specific types of actions and increases applicability.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. For example, an entity chosen to hold an item and being near the item results in the entity holding the item.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by merging similar effects.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity. \n\nThis merged action \"hold\" can be used in various contexts where an entity needs to hold an item, ensuring it is adaptable and maintains logical consistency across different tasks.",
    "In order to merge the given `stabilize_boat` action with other potentially similar actions into a more universal `stabilize` action, we'll aim to create an action that can be used in various contexts where stabilization is needed. Here\u2019s how the `stabilize` action might look after merging:\n\n```pddl\n(:action stabilize\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?environment - location)\n    :precondition (and (in_contact ?entity ?environment) (at ?entity near_stabilization_point) (not (stabilized ?entity)))\n    :effect (stabilized ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?entity` and `?environment` to allow this action to be applied to various scenarios beyond just a boat and passenger. This could involve stabilizing other entities in different environments.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are designed to clearly indicate the transition from an unstable to a stable state. It involves being in contact with the environment (like holding onto rails for a boat) and being near a point where stabilization can occur (such as being near the center of a boat).\n   \n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The logic retains the basic idea that contact and proximity to a stabilization point are required, and the outcome is that the entity becomes stabilized.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By using abstract parameters and conditions, the action avoids redundancy by not being specific to one scenario but rather applicable to any situation where stabilization is required.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the action makes sense whether it\u2019s applied to a boat, a platform, or any other stabilizable entity.\n\nThis merged action is designed to be flexible and adaptable, making it useful in a variety of stabilization tasks, from boats to potentially other scenarios like stabilizing a structure or a different type of vehicle."

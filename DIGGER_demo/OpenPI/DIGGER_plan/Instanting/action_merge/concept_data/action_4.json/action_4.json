    "To merge the given action into a more universal form while adhering to the guidelines provided, we can generalize the parameters, preconditions, and effects to cover a broader range of tasks. Here is how the merged action could be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action find ; Find an object and change its location\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?object - object ?from_location - location ?to_location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?from_location) (in_location ?object ?from_location))\n  :effect (and (in_location ?object ?to_location) (not (in_location ?object ?from_location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?agent`, `?object`, `?from_location`, and `?to_location` to apply to a variety of scenarios where an agent finds and relocates an object.\n   - The action is named \"find\" to imply the discovery and relocation process, which can be adapted to different contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure the agent is at the correct starting location and the object is there.\n   - The effects clearly describe moving the object from one location to another, indicating a state change from `?from_location` to `?to_location`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is concise, focusing only on the necessary steps to find and relocate an object, avoiding additional complexities.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across various potential scenarios, ensuring that the action is applicable and coherent in different contexts where an object needs to be found and moved.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various situations involving the relocation of objects by an agent, while the abstract parameters allow it to be adapted to specific implementations as needed.",

    "To create a merged action named `add` from the given action set, we'll focus on maintaining generality, clear state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's how the merged action could be designed:\n\n### Merged Action: add\n\n```lisp\n(:action add ; Add an item to a container and update inventory status\n :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object ?container - receptacle)\n :precondition (and (has ?agent ?item) (can_receive ?container))\n :effect (and (in ?item ?container) (not (has ?agent ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - We use abstract parameters such as `?agent`, `?item`, and `?container` to make the action applicable to a variety of tasks beyond the specific context of \"fairy moss\" and \"bowl\". This allows the action to be used in different scenarios where an entity is adding an object to a receptacle.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition `(has ?agent ?item)` ensures that the agent possesses the item before it can be added to the container.\n   - The precondition `(can_receive ?container)` checks that the container is capable of receiving the item, which is a generalized way to express conditions like \"fuller\" in the original action.\n   - The effect `(in ?item ?container)` represents the item being successfully added to the container.\n   - The effect `(not (has ?agent ?item))` updates the state to reflect that the agent no longer has the item in their possession, emphasizing the state transition.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action avoids redundancy by using simple conditions and effects, making it efficient and easy to understand.\n   - We removed specific constraints and identifiers (like `?p`, `?moss`, `?bowl`) to keep the action abstract and widely applicable.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic that can be applied in various contexts, ensuring that the action remains meaningful and applicable across different scenarios.\n\nThis merged action should effectively capture the essence of adding an item from an agent's possession to a container, making it broadly useful in planning domains where similar tasks are required.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named `prune`, we will follow the guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the detailed breakdown of how the merged action should look:\n\n### Action Name After Merge: prune\n\n### Action Sets That Need to be Merged:\n1. **ask_for_moss**\n    - **Parameters**: player, location, fairy moss\n    - **Preconditions**: The player is at the location where the moss is for sale.\n    - **Effects**: The moss is purchased and added to the player's inventory.\n\n2. **find_container**\n    - **Parameters**: player, container, location\n    - **Preconditions**: The player is at the location where the container is stored in the cabinet.\n    - **Effects**: The container is moved from the cabinet to the countertop.\n\n3. **fill_bowl**\n    - **Parameters**: player, bowl (container), water, location\n    - **Preconditions**: The player is at the location, the bowl is on the countertop, and water is available in the pipes.\n    - **Effects**: The bowl is filled with water, and the water is reduced from the pipes.\n\n4. **add_fairy_moss**\n    - **Parameters**: player, fairy moss, bowl (container)\n    - **Preconditions**: The player has the fairy moss in their inventory, and the bowl is filled with water.\n    - **Effects**: The fairy moss is added to the bowl, and it is removed from the player's inventory.\n\n5. **place_suitable_position**\n    - **Parameters**: player, bowl (container), location\n    - **Preconditions**: The bowl is filled with water and contains the fairy moss.\n    - **Effects**: The bowl is placed at the specified suitable location.\n\n6. **prune_fairy_moss**\n    - **Parameters**: player, fairy moss, bowl (container)\n    - **Preconditions**: The fairy moss is inside the bowl, and the player is at the bowl's location.\n    - **Effects**: The fairy moss is pruned.\n\n### Merged Action: prune\n\n```lisp\n(:action prune\n    :parameters (?p - player ?moss - fairy_moss ?cont - container ?loc - location ?water - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n        (at ?p ?loc)\n        (or\n            (and (for_sale ?moss ?loc) (not (in_inventory ?p ?moss)))\n            (and (in_inventory ?p ?moss) (filled ?cont ?water) (contains ?cont ?moss))\n            (and (stored ?cont ?loc) (not (on_counter ?cont)))\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (or\n            (and (in_inventory ?p ?moss) (not (for_sale ?moss ?loc)))\n            (and (on_counter ?cont) (not (stored ?cont ?loc)))\n            (and (filled ?cont ?water) (contains ?cont ?moss) (not (in_inventory ?p ?moss)))\n            (and (placed ?cont ?loc) (not (stored ?cont ?loc)))\n            (and (pruned ?moss))\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?p`, `?moss`, `?cont`, `?loc`, `?water`) to ensure it can handle a variety of tasks related to fairy moss handling and pruning.\n- **State Change**: The action preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes required to prune fairy moss, from purchasing, finding a container, filling it with water, adding moss, placing it in a suitable position, and finally pruning.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundant actions are merged to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects to ensure logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThe merged action `prune` covers the steps required to grow and prune fairy moss indoors, encapsulating the necessary state transitions in a single, generalizable action."

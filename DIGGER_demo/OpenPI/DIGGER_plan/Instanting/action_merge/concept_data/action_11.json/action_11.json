    "Sure, let's merge the provided `fill` action into a more general and adaptable action following the guidelines.\n\n### Original Actions:\n1. **fill_oil**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action fill_oil\n       :parameters (?ob - oil_bottle ?f - faucet)\n       :precondition (and (contains ?ob) (off ?f))\n       :effect (and (filled ?ob) (on ?f))\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action fill ; Fill a container with a resource\n  :parameters (?container - container ?resource - resource ?source - source)\n  :precondition (and (contains ?container) (off ?source))\n  :effect (and (filled ?container) (on ?source))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters have been made abstract (`?container - container`, `?resource - resource`, `?source - source`) to adapt to a variety of tasks.\n   - This action can apply to any filling task, not just oil and faucet but could be used for any container, resource, and source combination.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in the state of the items involved. The container must already contain something, and the source must be off before the action. The action results in the container being filled and the source being turned on.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action is simple, avoiding unnecessary complexity by focusing on the core logic of filling a container.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable for different contexts. The action's logic remains clear, ensuring that the parameters are appropriate for various filling tasks.\n\nBy following these guidelines and principles, the merged action should be able to cover a wide range of tasks involving filling a container with a resource from a source.",
    "To create a merged action named \"get\" that aligns with the provided guidelines and captures the essence of the diverse tasks involved in obtaining or manipulating oil-related entities, we will abstract the parameters to increase generality and ensure logical consistency. Here\u2019s the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action get ; Obtain a resource or update its state\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?resource - entity ?container - container ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?agent ?location) \n    (available ?resource ?location)\n    (contains ?container ?resource ?location)\n    (not (possesses ?agent ?resource))\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (possesses ?agent ?resource)\n    (empty ?container ?resource ?location)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `?agent` (representing who is performing the action, e.g., an NPC or player)\n     - `?resource` (the item being obtained or manipulated, e.g., oil, bung, oil cap)\n     - `?container` (the entity containing the resource, e.g., oil tank, bottle, bike)\n     - `?location` (the location where the action is performed)\n   - This abstraction allows the action to be applied to various entities and contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - `at ?agent ?location`: The agent is at the specified location.\n     - `available ?resource ?location`: The resource is available at the location.\n     - `contains ?container ?resource ?location`: The container holds the resource at the location.\n     - `not (possesses ?agent ?resource)`: The agent does not already possess the resource.\n   - **Effects**:\n     - `possesses ?agent ?resource`: The agent now possesses the resource.\n     - `empty ?container ?resource ?location`: The container no longer contains the resource at the location.\n   - These conditions clearly define how the state changes when the action is executed.\n\n3. **Core Logic and Simplicity**:\n   - The action retains the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\n   - It merges similar effects (obtaining or removing resources) and avoids redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects ensure a logical flow: the agent must be at the location, the resource must be available and contained within a container, and the agent should not already possess the resource.\n   - The state changes are consistent across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nBy following these guidelines, this merged action achieves the goal of combining multiple related actions into a single, adaptable, and efficient universal action."

    "(:action build ; Build or transform a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?entity - entity ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and (initial_state ?entity) (usable ?tool))\n  :effect (transformed ?entity)\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity - entity` and `?tool - tool`), which allows this action to be applied to various tasks beyond the specific examples provided (ingredients, chocolate, etc.).\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions indicate the initial state of the entity and the usability of the tool, while the effects show the transformation of the entity.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of the preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity. The action effectively conveys that an entity in its initial state can be transformed using a tool.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Merged actions with similar effects ensure simplicity and efficiency.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining consistency.",
    "Based on the guidelines provided for merging PDDL actions, the objective is to create a universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capturing and transforming the entity's state while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency. Given the examples of actions you provided, here's how the actions related to \"pour\" can be merged:\n\n```lisp\n(:action pour ; Pour a substance and transition its state\n    :parameters (?substance - entity ?container - entity)\n    :precondition (and (pourable ?substance) (receivable ?container))\n    :effect (and (contained ?substance ?container) (transformed ?substance))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is called `pour`, which conveys the general operation of transferring a substance into a container. The parameters `?substance` and `?container` are abstract enough to apply to various entities beyond just chocolate and bowls.\n\n2. **Abstract Parameters**:\n   - `?substance` and `?container` are used instead of specific types like `?c - chocolate` and `?b - mixing_bowl` to broaden applicability.\n\n3. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects focus on the transition of the substance's state. The precondition `(pourable ?substance)` abstracts the idea of liquid chocolate, while `(receivable ?container)` abstracts the idea of an empty bowl or mold.\n   - The effect `(contained ?substance ?container)` indicates the substance is now in the container, and `(transformed ?substance)` indicates a state change (e.g., from liquid to solid).\n\n4. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - The merged action removes unnecessary complexity by focusing on core logic\u2014pouring and containing\u2014and it avoids redundancy by merging similar state changes (e.g., from liquid to in molds).\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent. The action requires that the substance be pourable and the container be able to receive it. The effects clearly show the outcome of the action, maintaining consistency across different substances and containers.\n\nThis merged action serves as a universal template for tasks involving pouring and transitioning the state of a substance within a container, applicable to a variety of contexts beyond the specific scenarios initially provided.",
    "(:action freeze ; Freeze an item and update its state\n  :parameters (?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (in_molds ?item) (liquid ?item))\n  :effect (and (frozen ?item) (solid ?item))\n)",
    "To merge multiple PDDL actions into a single, universal action while maintaining generality, capturing state changes, and preserving logical consistency, we can follow the provided guidelines. Here is how to create the merged action named \"cut\" from the given action sets:\n\n### Original Actions:\n1. **cut_heart_shape**\n   ```\n   (:action cut_heart_shape\n       :parameters (?v - velveeta)\n       :precondition (and (cubed ?v) (on_cutting_board ?v))\n       :effect (heart_shaped ?v)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action \"cut\":\nTo generalize the \"cut\" action and make it adaptable to various tasks, we will use abstract parameters and ensure that the action's preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. We will avoid redundancy and maintain simplicity.\n\n### Merged Action:\n```\n(:action cut\n    :parameters (?item - object ?shape - shape)\n    :precondition (and (cubed ?item) (on_cutting_board ?item))\n    :effect (shaped ?item ?shape)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?item` (object) and `?shape` (shape) to ensure the action can be applied to various items and shapes rather than being limited to \"velveeta\" and \"heart shape\". This increases the action's applicability to a variety of tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions specify that the item must be `cubed` and `on_cutting_board`, reflecting the necessary state before the action can be applied.\n   - The effect specifies that the item will be `shaped` into the specified shape, indicating the state change.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - The core logic remains consistent, ensuring that the item must meet certain conditions before it can be cut into the desired shape.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The action is simplified to avoid unnecessary complexity while merging similar effects. It combines the essence of cutting any cubed item into any shape.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged \"cut\" action is adaptable, simple, and logically consistent, making it suitable for a variety of tasks involving cutting objects into different shapes."

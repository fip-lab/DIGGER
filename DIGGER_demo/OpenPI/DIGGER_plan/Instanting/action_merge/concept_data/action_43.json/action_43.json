    "\nTo merge the provided PDDL actions into a single, universal action named \"make,\" we need to ensure that the action is general enough to be applicable across various tasks while maintaining the core logic of preconditions and effects. Here is how you can represent the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action make ; Make a connection or assignment to update the state\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?target) (not (made ?target)))\n    :effect (made ?target)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The abstract parameters `?agent` and `?target` replace specific types like `?p` (player) and `?mic` (microphone). This allows the action to apply to a wide range of tasks, not just connecting a microphone but potentially any situation requiring an assignment or connection.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(at ?agent ?target)` ensures that the agent is in the correct state or location to interact with the target.\n   - The effect `(made ?target)` signifies that the target has been successfully altered or assigned, reflecting a change in state.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The precondition `(not (made ?target))` ensures that the action is only executed if the target hasn't already been altered or assigned, retaining the core logic of the original action.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By using abstract terms and eliminating task-specific details, redundancy is minimized, and the action can be applied more broadly.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions (i.e., the agent must be at the target) and effects (i.e., the target becomes made).\n\nThis merged action can now be adapted to various contexts where an entity needs to create or establish a connection or assignment, making it versatile and useful in different scenarios.",
    "Based on the provided examples and guidelines, we will merge the given actions into a single universal action named `find`. This merged action will be adaptable to various tasks that involve finding or discovering an entity, ensuring generality, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action find ; Find an entity and update its visibility status\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?entity) (not (visible ?entity)))\n    :effect (visible ?entity)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action is generalized to apply to any agent finding any object, not limited to specific types like `player` or `panel`.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change, capturing the essence of finding an entity and updating its visibility status.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing only on the relevant state changes.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions (agent must be at the entity's location and the entity must not be visible) and effects (making the entity visible), ensuring logical consistency across different tasks.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged `find` action is adaptable, simple, and logically consistent, suitable for a variety of tasks involving discovering and updating the state of entities.",
    "(:action check\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity - entity)\n    :precondition (and (available ?agent) (not (checked ?agent ?entity)))\n    :effect (checked ?agent ?entity)\n)",
    "To combine the given actions into a single universal action named \"talk,\" we need to maintain generality, ensure clear state changes, avoid redundancy, and keep logical consistency. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n### Merged Action: `talk`\n```pddl\n(:action talk\n    :parameters (?p - player ?mic - microphone ?voice - voice ?advice - advice ?panel - panel)\n    :precondition (and \n        (or (not (connected ?mic)) ; Microphone is not connected\n            (and (connected ?mic) ; Microphone is connected, player at microphone, and voice not heard\n                 (at ?p ?mic) \n                 (not (heard ?voice))))\n        (or (not (visible ?panel)) ; Panel is not visible\n            (and (visible ?panel) ; Panel is visible and not selected\n                 (not (selected ?panel))))\n        (or (not (efficient ?voice)) ; Voice is not efficient\n            (and (efficient ?voice) ; Voice is efficient and advice not given\n                 (not (given ?advice))))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (connected ?mic) ; Microphone becomes connected\n        (visible ?panel) ; Panel becomes visible\n        (selected ?panel) ; Panel becomes selected\n        (heard ?voice) ; Voice becomes heard\n        (efficient ?voice) ; Voice becomes efficient\n        (given ?advice) ; Advice becomes given\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"talk\" uses abstract parameters (`?p`, `?mic`, `?voice`, `?advice`, `?panel`) to adapt to various tasks involving the use of a microphone, checking a panel, and giving advice.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are structured to reflect state changes accurately:\n   - **Microphone**: Connects if not already connected.\n   - **Panel**: Becomes visible and selected if not already visible and selected.\n   - **Voice**: Becomes heard and efficient.\n   - **Advice**: Becomes given.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and ensuring a streamlined set of preconditions and effects.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logically consistent and ensure that each state change is meaningful and necessary for the goal.\n\nThis merged action captures the core logic of checking, modifying, and creating states, making it adaptable and efficient for various tasks involving communication and interaction in a game or simulation environment.",

    "To create a merged action named \"cut\" that is adaptable to various tasks involving cutting, we will abstract the parameters and generalize the preconditions and effects. Here's how the merged action could look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action cut ; Cut an item into specified pieces\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?surface - surface)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?surface) (at ?item ?surface) (whole ?item))\n  :effect (and (cut ?item) (not (whole ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action is named \"cut\" and uses abstract parameters such as `?agent` for the entity performing the action, `?item` for the object being cut, and `?surface` for the location where the cutting occurs. This allows the action to be used in various contexts beyond just cutting velveeta.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition specifies that the item must be whole and located on the specified surface along with the agent. The effect reflects the transformation of the item's state from whole to cut, achieving the goal of altering the item's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by using generalized terms like `cut` instead of specifics like `cut_into_cubes`, making it more adaptable and reducing unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across tasks by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are coherent and applicable to various scenarios involving cutting actions. The logic is simple and clear, focusing on the state change of making an item no longer whole.",
    "To create a merged action named `set` that captures the essence of the provided PDDL action set, we must focus on the generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency of the action. Given the guidelines and the example action provided, here's how the merged action can be structured:\n\n```lisp\n(:action set ; Set a condition or state change for a task\n :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object ?location - place ?state - state)\n :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (not (in ?resource ?state)) (condition ?resource ?location))\n :effect (and (in ?resource ?state) (not (condition ?resource ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstract: `?actor`, `?resource`, `?location`, and `?state`, which can adapt to various tasks involving setting or transitioning states.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects clearly indicate a change in state. The action represents moving a resource into a new state (e.g., turning on a burner or adding cheese to a pot).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant details are omitted, focusing only on necessary conditions and effects. This ensures a clean and efficient representation.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects for various contexts, ensuring logical integrity across possible tasks.\n\nThis merged action structure allows for broad application across different types of tasks, maintaining flexibility and clarity.",
    "To create a merged action named \"add\" that incorporates the logic of the given action example, we need to ensure that the action is generalized, captures the state change, and maintains logical consistency across different contexts. Here's how we can achieve that:\n\n### Merged Action: Add\n\n```pddl\n(:action add\n  ; General action to add an item to a location and update its state\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?container - container ?condition - state)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?container) \n                     (at ?item ?origin) \n                     (state ?item ?condition))\n  :effect (and (in ?item ?container) \n               (updated_state ?item ?condition))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?item`, `?container`, `?condition`) to generalize across various scenarios involving adding an item to a container and updating its state. This makes the action adaptable to different tasks.\n\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the actor is at the container location and that the item is in the appropriate state to be added. The effects describe the new state of the system after the action is executed, with the item being in the container and its state being updated.\n\n- **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward and avoids redundancy by focusing on the core logic of adding an item and updating its state.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent with the task of adding an item, ensuring that the action can be applied in a variety of situations while maintaining reasonable logic.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of adding an item and updating its state, making it applicable to a wide range of tasks while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"serve,\" we'll generalize the parameters, simplify the preconditions and effects, and ensure logical consistency across tasks. Here's how the merged action can be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action serve\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?location - location ?state_change - state ?resource - resource)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?location) (not_completed ?resource) (prepared ?resource) (active ?state_change))\n  :effect (and (served ?resource) (not (active ?state_change)) (completed ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - Parameters are abstract, allowing the action to be adapted to various resources, locations, and state changes.\n   - The action is designed to be applicable to tasks involving serving, completing, or finalizing a process.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions reflect the necessity of the person being at a specific location, the resource not yet being completed, the resource being prepared, and an active state change (e.g., a stove being on).\n   - Effects indicate that the resource is served, the active state change is reversed (e.g., turning off the stove), and the resource is marked as completed.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - By abstracting parameters and focusing on core preconditions and effects, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain reasonable logic that can be applied to various contexts, ensuring the action's adaptability.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the steps required to perform a task similar to serving cheese sauce while remaining adaptable to a broader range of tasks that involve completing a process and serving a resource."

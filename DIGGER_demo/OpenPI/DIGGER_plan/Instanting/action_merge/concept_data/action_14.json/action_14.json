    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action that meets the outlined objectives and guidelines, we can follow a structured approach:\n\n**Merged Action:**\n\n```pddl\n(:action choose ; Choose an option and update its status\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?option - object ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and (not (selected ?option)) (context_applicable ?context ?option))\n    :effect (and (selected ?option) (context_updated ?context))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters like `?agent`, `?option`, and `?context` to ensure it can be applied to a variety of tasks beyond the specific actions provided. This allows it to generalize across scenarios where an entity makes a choice or selection.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the `?option` is not already selected and that the `?context` is applicable for this selection. This reflects a clear before-and-after state change, where the entity's state progresses toward a goal of having the option selected and context updated.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action combines the core logic of selecting an option and updating the context without unnecessary complexity. It avoids redundancy by capturing the essence of choosing something and updating its related state.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that only applicable contexts allow for selection and that the effects update both the option and the context appropriately. This ensures reasonable preconditions and effects across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to various tasks involving selection and updating states, aligning with the outlined objectives and guidelines.",
    "To effectively merge the given actions into a single, universal action that can adapt to different tasks, we need to identify the core similarities in their logic and abstract their parameters and effects. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action move\n    :parameters (?entity - agent ?destination - location)\n    :precondition (and (location ?entity ?current_location) (not (location ?entity ?destination)))\n    :effect (and (not (location ?entity ?current_location)) (location ?entity ?destination))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is named \"move\" to generalize the concept of changing an entity's location or state.\n   - The parameters `?entity` and `?destination` use abstract types (`agent` and `location`) to make the action adaptable to various contexts, whether they involve players, objects, or abstract tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions require that the `?entity` is currently not at the `?destination` and that a current location exists.\n   - The effects ensure that the `?entity` is moved to the `?destination`, reflecting a clear change in state.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - By using abstract parameters and focusing on the core logic of moving from one location to another, redundancy is minimized, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across tasks, ensuring that the action can be applied in different scenarios without additional complexity.\n\nThis merged action can be used to represent various tasks involving movement or changes in state while maintaining clarity and adaptability."

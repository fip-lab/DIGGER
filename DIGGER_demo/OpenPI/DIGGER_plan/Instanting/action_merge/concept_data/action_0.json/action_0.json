    "Here's how you can merge the given actions into a single, universal PDDL action named `plug`, following the guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n```pddl\n(:action plug\n    ; Universal plugging action for connecting devices and cables\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?device1 - object ?device2 - object ?cable - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?actor ?device1)\n        (at ?actor ?device2)\n        (or (has_hdmi_port ?device1) (has_av_output ?device1) (not (connected ?device1 ?device2)))\n        (or (has_hdmi_port ?device2) (not (connected ?cable ?device1)) (not (connected ?cable ?device2))))\n    :effect (and \n        (connected ?device1 ?device2)\n        (connected ?cable ?device1)\n        (connected ?cable ?device2)\n        (power ?device1)\n        (power ?device2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?device1`, `?device2`, `?cable`) to ensure it can be applied across various scenarios involving different devices and cables.\n  \n- **State Change**: The precondition checks if the actor is at both devices and if the devices have the appropriate ports or outputs. The effects ensure that the devices and cables are connected and powered if applicable.\n\n- **Simplicity**: Redundancies are removed by using a single action to handle multiple connection scenarios. The logic is streamlined by using `or` conditions to cater to different types of connections (HDMI, AV).\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain reasonable logic, ensuring that devices are checked for ports before connections are made, and power is applied consistently where needed."

    "To create a merged action for the task \"mix,\" we need to ensure that the action is general enough to apply to various mixing tasks, while maintaining logical consistency, state changes, and simplicity. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action mix ; Mix a set of items to create a new state\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?entity - item ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (at ?entity ?location) (not (combined ?entity)))\n  :effect (and (combined ?entity) (not (separate ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?actor`, `?entity`, and `?location` to ensure the action applies to various scenarios involving agents (e.g., players, characters) mixing items or entities at specific locations.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the actor and entity are at the same location and that the entity is not already in a \"combined\" state.\n   - The effects reflect the state change by marking the entity as \"combined\" and ensuring it is no longer \"separate.\"\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action is kept simple by using straightforward conditions and effects, without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The logical flow of preconditions and effects is maintained to ensure that the action can be consistently applied in different contexts where mixing or combining is required.",
    "Given the task of merging actions to create a universal action named `pour`, we can follow the provided guidelines to combine the actions into a single, adaptable action. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n  ; Pour a substance into a container\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?substance - substance ?container - container ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (at ?substance ?location) (at ?container ?location) (prepared ?substance) (empty ?container))\n  :effect (and (in_container ?substance ?container) (not (empty ?container)) (fuller ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is named `pour` and uses abstract parameters such as `?agent`, `?substance`, `?container`, and `?location`, making it adaptable to various tasks involving pouring a substance into a container.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions specify that the agent, substance, and container must all be at the same location, the substance must be prepared (mixed), and the container must be empty.\n   - The effects reflect the state change: the substance is now in the container, the container is no longer empty, and it is fuller.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids unnecessary complexity by merging the relevant conditions and effects into a single, straightforward set of parameters and logical statements.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain consistency across different tasks involving pouring, ensuring that the action can be applied in various contexts without ambiguity.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action is simple, efficient, and broadly applicable to different scenarios where pouring a substance into a container is required.",
    "(:action grind ;  Perform a grinding action on a resource and update its state\n:parameters (?entity - player ?resource - object ?tool - tool ?location - place)\n:precondition (and (at ?entity ?location) (at ?resource ?location) (at ?tool ?location) (not (processed ?resource)))\n:effect (and (processed ?resource) (dirty ?tool))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `grind` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks that involve a player using a tool to process a resource at a specific location. The use of abstract parameters (?entity, ?resource, ?tool, ?location) ensures that the action can be applied to different scenarios involving grinding or similar processes.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The resource (?resource) is transformed from an unprocessed state to a processed state, and the tool (?tool) becomes dirty.\n   \n3. **Simplicity**: Redundant or overly specific details have been removed to ensure the action remains simple and efficient. For example, the specific objects like `mixture` and `mortar_and_pestle` have been generalized to `resource` and `tool`.\n   \n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. The entity must be at the location with the resource and the tool for the action to take place, ensuring logical consistency.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of contexts where grinding or a similar processing action is required.",
    "### Merged Action: `process_item`\n\n```lisp\n(:action process_item ; Generalized action to process an item and update its state\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object ?tool - object ?loc - location ?state1 - state ?state2 - state)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?loc) (at ?item ?loc) (at ?tool ?loc) (?state1 ?item) (not (?state2 ?item)))\n  :effect (and (?state2 ?item) (not (?state1 ?item)) (tool_used ?tool))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action `process_item` uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?item`, `?tool`, `?loc`, `?state1`, and `?state2`) to cover a wide range of tasks including mixing, pouring, grinding, and moving.\n   - It can be adapted to various scenarios by specifying different tools and states.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the agent, item, and tool are in the same location and that the item is initially in a specific state (`?state1`).\n   - The effects describe the state change of the item from `?state1` to `?state2` and record the tool as used (`tool_used ?tool`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar actions into a single, flexible action.\n   - The merged action maintains core logic without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are clearly defined to maintain consistency across different contexts.\n   - The action ensures that the item changes state only if the preconditions are met, providing logical consistency.\n\n### Examples:\n\n1. **Mix Ingredients**:\n   - Specific instance of `process_item` where `?state1` is `not mixed` and `?state2` is `mixed`.\n   ```lisp\n   (:action mix_ingredients\n     :parameters (?player - agent ?mixture - object ?loc - location)\n     :precondition (process_item ?player ?mixture ?tool ?loc (not mixed) mixed)\n     :effect (process_item ?player ?mixture ?tool ?loc (not mixed) mixed)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Pour into Container**:\n   - Specific instance of `process_item` where `?state1` is `empty` and `?state2` is `full`.\n   ```lisp\n   (:action pour_into_container\n     :parameters (?player - agent ?mixture - object ?container - object ?loc - location)\n     :precondition (process_item ?player ?mixture ?container ?loc (not full) full)\n     :effect (process_item ?player ?mixture ?container ?loc (not full) full)\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Grind Ingredients**:\n   - Specific instance of `process_item` where `?state1` is `not ground` and `?state2` is `ground`.\n   ```lisp\n   (:action grind_ingredients\n     :parameters (?player - agent ?mixture - object ?mortar_pestle - object ?loc - location)\n     :precondition (process_item ?player ?mixture ?mortar_pestle ?loc (not ground) ground)\n     :effect (process_item ?player ?mixture ?mortar_pestle ?loc (not ground) ground)\n   )\n   ```\n\n4. **Move to Location**:\n   - Specific instance of `process_item` where `?state1` is `at ?loc1` and `?state2` is `at ?loc2`.\n   ```lisp\n   (:action gotolocation\n     :parameters (?agent - agent ?container - object ?loc1 - location ?loc2 - location)\n     :precondition (process_item ?agent ?container ?tool ?loc1 (at ?loc1) (at ?loc2))\n     :effect (process_item ?agent ?container ?tool ?loc1 (at ?loc1) (at ?loc2))\n   )\n   ```\n\nThis generalized action framework allows for a versatile and efficient representation of various tasks involving state changes, ensuring simplicity and logical consistency."

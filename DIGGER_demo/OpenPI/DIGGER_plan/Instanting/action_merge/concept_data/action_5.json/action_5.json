    "To merge the given action set into a single, universal \"obtain\" action, we will follow the provided guidelines to ensure generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. The merged action will be adaptable to various tasks involving obtaining an item or resource.\n\n### Merged Action Definition\n\n```pddl\n(:action obtain ; Obtain a resource and update possession status\n :parameters (?p - agent ?item - object)\n :precondition (and (at ?item location) (not (inventory ?p ?item)))\n :effect (and (inventory ?p ?item) (not (at ?item location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters `?p` (representing any agent) and `?item` (representing any object), making it applicable to a wide range of tasks where an agent needs to obtain an item or resource.\n\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transition in the state. The item must be at a location initially, and after the action, it is in the agent's inventory, and no longer at the original location.\n\n- **Simplicity:** The action is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary parameters or conditions. It focuses on the core logic required to change the possession status of an item.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action ensures that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and consistent across different contexts. The logic of obtaining an item is maintained clearly and understandably.\n\nThis merged \"obtain\" action can be extended or adapted for more specific scenarios by adjusting or adding parameters and conditions as needed, while keeping the core logic intact.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"kneel,\" we need to ensure that the action is general, avoids redundancy, and logically consistent. Here's the merged action:\n\n### Action after merging:\n```lisp\n(:action kneel ; Kneel and perform a task on an item\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?surface - surface)\n  :precondition (and (at ?p ?surface) (inventory ?p ?item) (stained ?surface))\n  :effect (and (clean ?surface) (not (stained ?surface)) (getting_smaller ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action is named \"kneel,\" indicating a general posture to perform a task. Parameters are abstract enough to apply to various items and surfaces.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect a clear transformation of the entity's state, from a stained surface to a clean one, and the item used (e.g., eraser) gets smaller.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining the essential elements of the tasks into a single action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency, ensuring that the person must be at the surface, have the item, and the surface must be stained before cleaning occurs.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to various contexts where a person kneels to perform a cleaning task with an item, ensuring it meets the guidelines provided.",
    "The merged action, considering the objectives and guidelines provided, would be as follows:\n\n```pddl\n(:action rub ; Perform a cleaning action to transform the state of an object\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?tool - object ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (inventory ?agent ?tool) (needs_cleaning ?target))\n    :effect (and (clean ?target) (not (needs_cleaning ?target)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action is defined with abstract parameters: `?agent`, `?tool`, and `?target`, allowing it to be applicable to a variety of scenarios involving cleaning or transforming objects.\n   - The precondition and effect use generic predicates like `needs_cleaning` and `clean` to increase applicability across different tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The action represents a state change where an object (`?target`) that needs cleaning is transformed into a clean state.\n   - The precondition ensures that the agent is present at the location and has the required tool, which is common logic for many cleaning or modifying actions.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundant steps like `rub_with_rubber` have been removed, focusing on the core logic necessary for the action.\n   - The action is streamlined to avoid complexity while maintaining essential conditions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains a logical flow: an agent uses a tool to clean a target, consistent with cleaning tasks.\n   - Preconditions and effects are straightforward and adaptable to various contexts where cleaning or state transformation is required. \n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the given tasks while remaining flexible for different scenarios."

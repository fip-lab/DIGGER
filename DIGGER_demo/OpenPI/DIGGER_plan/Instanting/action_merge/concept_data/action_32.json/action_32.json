    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal PDDL action named \"clean,\" we need to ensure that the action is general enough to apply to various cleaning tasks, clearly describes state changes, and avoids redundancy. Here's how the merged action can be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean ; Clean a specified area or item and update its status\n  :parameters (?agent - player ?target - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?target ?location)\n    (at ?agent ?location)\n    (or (dusty ?location) (full ?target) (dirty ?target)))\n  :effect (and\n    (or (dust_free ?location) (clean ?target) (not (full ?target)))\n    (not (or (dusty ?location) (dirty ?target) (full ?target))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action uses abstract parameters: `?agent` for the player performing the action, `?target` for the object to be cleaned, and `?location` for the location where the cleaning takes place.\n   - The precondition checks for various states that require cleaning, such as a dusty location, a full trash basket, or a dirty surface.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The action's effects reflect the change in state, such as making a location dust-free, cleaning an object, or emptying a trash basket.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:**\n   - The merged action combines similar actions (dusting, emptying trash, and cleaning surfaces) into a single, simple structure.\n   - By using logical \"or\" conditions, it captures different cleaning scenarios without needing separate actions for each.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain consistency by ensuring that the necessary conditions for cleaning are met and that the effects accurately represent the result of the cleaning action.\n\nThis merged action should be applicable to various tasks that involve cleaning different parts of a house or objects within a location, providing a flexible and efficient way to model these tasks in PDDL.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal action that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, logical consistency, and avoiding redundancy, we'll combine the provided actions as follows:\n\n### Merged Action: pickup\n```pddl\n(:action pickup\n  :parameters (?item - object ?container - object ?agent - person)\n  :precondition (and (at ?item around_house) (at ?agent around_house))\n  :effect (and (inventory ?agent ?item) (not (at ?item around_house)) (at ?item ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters have been generalized to `?item` and `?container` to cover a variety of objects and containers, making the action adaptable to different tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that both the item and the agent are in the same location, and the effects reflect the state change by moving the item to the agent's inventory and optionally placing it in a specified container.\n3. **Simplicity**: By combining the actions `pickup_items` and `pickup_throw_rugs`, redundancy is avoided, and the action is kept efficient and straightforward.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring they make sense for various tasks involving picking up items.\n\nWith this merged `pickup` action, the agent can now handle a variety of tasks involving picking up different items and placing them in containers, all while maintaining the necessary preconditions and effects for state changes."

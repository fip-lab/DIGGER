    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"cook,\" we need to ensure that the merged action adheres to the criteria of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. The \"cook\" action should be adaptable to a variety of cooking-related tasks. However, since you provided only one specific cooking action and no other actions to merge with it, I will illustrate how the given action can be generalized and simplified, assuming a hypothetical \"drink_water\" action is similar in concept and needs merging.\n\n### Given Actions:\n1. **cook**\n   - Parameters: `(?npc - player ?meat - item ?onion - item ?pan - item ?stove - item)`\n   - Preconditions: `(and (at ?npc ?stove) (at ?meat ?stove) (at ?onion ?stove) (is_pan ?pan) (is_stove ?stove) (is_raw_meat ?meat) (is_raw_vegetable ?onion))`\n   - Effects: `(and (is_cooked ?meat) (is_cooked ?onion) (dirty ?pan))`\n\n2. **Hypothetical drink_water**\n   - Parameters: `(?npc - player ?cup - item ?water - item)`\n   - Preconditions: `(and (at ?npc ?water) (in ?water ?cup) (is_drinkable ?water))`\n   - Effects: `(and (hydrated ?npc) (empty ?cup))`\n\n### Merged Action: cook\n```pddl\n(:action cook\n    :parameters (?npc - player ?resource1 - item ?resource2 - item ?tool1 - item ?tool2 - item)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?tool2) (at ?resource1 ?tool2) (at ?resource2 ?tool2) \n                       (is_tool1 ?tool1) (is_tool2 ?tool2) (is_raw ?resource1) (is_raw ?resource2))\n    :effect (and (processed ?resource1) (processed ?resource2) (dirty ?tool1))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The merged action \"cook\" is designed to handle various resource transformations, applicable to tasks like cooking or preparing items.\n- **Parameters:** Abstract parameters like `?resource1`, `?resource2`, `?tool1`, and `?tool2` are used to increase adaptability to different tasks. For example, `?resource1` and `?resource2` can be any items that need processing.\n- **Preconditions:** Conditions ensure that the player and resources are in the correct location and that the tool is appropriate for the task.\n- **Effects:** The effects capture the transformation of raw resources into processed states, which could mean cooking, cleaning, or any other processing task, and also track the change in tool state (e.g., becoming dirty).\n\nThis merged action provides a framework to handle a range of related tasks by adjusting parameters and preconditions/effects for specific contexts, ensuring flexibility and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action \"drink\" that captures the essence of the provided actions, we will follow the guidelines to ensure generality, clarity in state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency. The merged action should be adaptable to various contexts involving drinking, making it suitable for different tasks.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action drink\n  ; Action to drink a liquid from a source and update the entity's state\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?source - item ?liquid - liquid)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?source) (is_source ?source) (contains ?source ?liquid) (power_on ?source))\n  :effect (hydrated ?npc)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"drink\" to represent the general activity of drinking any liquid from a source.\n   - The parameters are abstract (?npc for the person, ?source for the item providing the liquid, and ?liquid for the liquid itself), making the action adaptable to various scenarios.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the person (?npc) is at the source (?source), the source is a valid provider of the liquid (is_source), the source contains the liquid (contains), and the source is operational (power_on).\n   - The effect describes the change in the state of the person (?npc) to hydrated, reflecting the outcome of the action.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action eliminates redundancy by combining similar conditions and effects into a single, clear action.\n   - The action is concise and directly addresses the state changes needed for the \"drink\" task.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different contexts.\n   - The action maintains a clear and straightforward logic that can be applied to various scenarios involving drinking.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"drink\" is both versatile and efficient, capturing the core logic and state changes necessary for a wide range of drinking-related tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action called \"add,\" we will follow the guidelines to ensure generality, clear state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action add ; Add an item to a container or location\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?container - object ?location - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?npc ?location) \n        (at ?item ?location) \n        (at ?container ?location) \n        (is_container ?container) \n        (is_item ?item) \n        (is_location ?location) \n        (clean ?container) \n        (suitable ?location))\n    :effect (and \n        (item_in_container ?item ?container) \n        (dirty ?container) \n        (modified ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is generalized to apply to multiple tasks involving adding items to containers or locations.\n   - Parameters are abstract (`?npc`, `?item`, `?container`, `?location`) to fit various contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the necessary conditions for the action (e.g., the NPC, item, and container are at the location, the container is clean).\n   - Effects describe the state change clearly: the item is added to the container, the container becomes dirty, and the container is modified.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions and effects are removed.\n   - The action is kept simple and efficient, focusing on the core logic of adding items to containers or locations.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts.\n   - The action maintains a logical flow, ensuring clarity and reasonableness in various scenarios.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"add\" is adaptable to a variety of tasks and maintains clarity and simplicity.",
    "To create a universal \"finish\" action that combines elements from various tasks while maintaining generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we first need to abstract the parameters and conditions from the given actions and entity states. The goal is to capture the essence of completing or finalizing tasks in different contexts.\n\nHere's the merged \"finish\" action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action finish ; Complete a task or process for an entity\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?entity - item)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?entity) (in_progress ?entity))\n    :effect (and (completed ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `?actor` is a general agent that can be any player or character.\n  - `?entity` is a general item or task that the actor interacts with to complete.\n\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - `(at ?actor ?entity)`: The actor must be at the location of the entity, ensuring they can interact with it.\n  - `(in_progress ?entity)`: The entity must be in a state of being worked on, which is a common condition across tasks when something is being finished.\n\n- **Effects:**\n  - `(completed ?entity)`: The primary effect is the transition of the entity from an in-progress state to a completed state, which applies to various contexts like finishing a wreath or any other task.\n\n### Applicability:\n\nThis merged action is designed to be general enough to apply to various types of tasks where an agent or actor completes an item or process. It abstracts the specifics of individual actions into a common pattern of finishing or completing tasks, ensuring it can be used in multiple scenarios without losing the core logic of preconditions and effects."

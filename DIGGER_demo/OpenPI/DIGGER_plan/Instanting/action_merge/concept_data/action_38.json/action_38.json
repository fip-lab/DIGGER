    "Here is the merged action based on the provided actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action shotgun ; Perform a shotgun shot and update the state\n  :parameters (?shooter - player ?target - player)\n  :precondition (and \n    (has_shotgun ?shooter)\n    (or \n      (and (enemy ?target ?shooter) (in_range ?shooter ?target))\n      (self ?target ?shooter)\n    )\n  )\n  :effect (or \n    (headshot ?shooter ?target)\n    (self_shot ?shooter)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Generality:\n- The merged action is named `shotgun`, which is a general term for performing any shotgun-related action.\n- Parameters are abstract, where `?shooter` and `?target` are both players, making the action applicable to various contexts where a player uses a shotgun.\n\n#### State Change:\n- The preconditions and effects are designed to reflect state changes clearly:\n  - Preconditions: The shooter must have a shotgun, and either the target is an enemy in range or the shooter is aiming at themselves.\n  - Effects: The target may either be headshot (if they are an enemy) or the shooter may self-inflict a shot.\n\n#### Simplicity:\n- The action avoids redundancy by combining similar preconditions and effects.\n- The action is efficient and straightforward, removing unnecessary complexity.\n\n#### Logical Consistency:\n- The preconditions and effects are consistent across different tasks:\n  - The action logically checks if the shooter has a shotgun and whether the target is an enemy in range or the shooter themselves.\n  - The effects logically follow from the preconditions, ensuring that the state change is reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action covers the core logic of both shooting an enemy and shooting oneself with a shotgun, maintaining simplicity and adaptability for various scenarios.",
    "To merge the actions related to the \"pistol\" category into a single universal action, we need to consider the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's how we can approach it:\n\n### Action Sets to be Merged:\n1. `(:action pistol_shot\n      :parameters (?p1 - player ?p2 - player)\n      :precondition (and (has_pistol ?p1) (enemy ?p2 ?p1) (in_range ?p1 ?p2))\n      :effect (and (headshot ?p1 ?p2))\n   )`\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action use_pistol\n   :parameters (?shooter - player ?target - player ?pistol - object)\n   :precondition (and (has_weapon ?shooter ?pistol) (enemy ?target ?shooter) (in_range ?shooter ?target) (type ?pistol pistol))\n   :effect (and (neutralized ?shooter ?target))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `use_pistol` uses abstract parameters (`?shooter`, `?target`, and `?pistol`) to generalize the action to any scenario involving a pistol, not just a specific type of shot.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the shooter has the weapon, the target is an enemy, and they are in range. The effect reflects a state change where the target is neutralized, which is a more general outcome than just a headshot.\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action combines the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity. The use of abstract parameters and generalized conditions avoids redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring the shooter has a weapon, the target is an enemy, and they are within range. The effect (`neutralized ?shooter ?target`) is logically consistent with the given preconditions.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various tasks involving a pistol, maintaining clarity and efficiency while avoiding redundancy.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can create a merged action called `shoot`. This action will abstract away the specific type of weapon and target, allowing for flexibility in different shooting scenarios. Here's how the merged action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action shoot ; Shoot a target with a specified weapon\n  :parameters (?player - player ?weapon - weapon ?target - target)\n  :precondition (and (has_weapon ?player ?weapon)\n                     (loaded ?weapon)\n                     (in_range ?player ?target))\n  :effect (and (shot ?target ?player))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters: `?player`, `?weapon`, and `?target`. \n   - This allows the action to be applicable to various scenarios involving different players, weapons, and targets (including self-targeting).\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The precondition `(in_range ?player ?target)` ensures the player is in range to shoot the target.\n   - The effect `(shot ?target ?player)` captures the result of shooting, which can be further specified as a headshot or another type of hit in more detailed actions if needed.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - The merged action removes redundancy by combining similar actions (e.g., different weapon types) into one.\n   - It omits specific conditions like `enemy` status or self-targeting since these can be handled by further refining the `?target` parameter if needed.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency across different use cases by ensuring that all necessary conditions (having the weapon, it being loaded, and being in range) are met before the shot can occur.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the `shoot` action becomes a versatile tool that can model shooting in a variety of contexts without being overly specific or complex."

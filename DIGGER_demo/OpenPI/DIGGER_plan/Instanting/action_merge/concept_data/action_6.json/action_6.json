    "To merge the actions into a single universal action called `purchase`, while maintaining generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can define the merged action as follows:\n\n```pddl\n(:action purchase\n    :parameters (?user - user ?item - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?user ?location) (for_sale ?item ?location))\n    :effect (and (purchased ?item ?user) (not (for_sale ?item ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Action Name:** `purchase`\n   - The action is named `purchase` to indicate the general task of acquiring an item.\n\n2. **Parameters:**\n   - `?user` (the user performing the action)\n   - `?item` (the object being purchased, which could be an eraser, wick, or other objects)\n   - `?location` (the location where the purchase is made, such as a store or other relevant place)\n\n3. **Preconditions:**\n   - `(at ?user ?location)`: The user must be at the specified location.\n   - `(for_sale ?item ?location)`: The item must be available for sale at the location.\n\n4. **Effects:**\n   - `(purchased ?item ?user)`: The item is now considered purchased by the user.\n   - `(not (for_sale ?item ?location))`: The item is no longer available for sale at the location.\n\n### Key Features of the Merged Action:\n\n- **Generality:** The use of abstract parameters like `?item` and `?location` makes this action adaptable to various purchasing scenarios, not just limited to specific items like erasers or wicks.\n  \n- **State Change:** Clearly defines the transition of the item from being for sale to being purchased, reflecting the change in its state.\n\n- **Simplicity:** Combines the purchasing logic into a single action, removing redundant steps and focusing on the core logic of acquiring an item.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** Maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring that the action can be applied across different contexts without losing its fundamental purpose.\n\nBy using this merged action, you can efficiently describe purchasing tasks across different scenarios while maintaining clarity and adaptability.",
    "To create a universal action named \"attach\" by merging the given action set, we need to ensure that it is general enough to apply to various tasks while maintaining logical consistency and efficiency. Here is how the merged action could be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action attach ; Attach an item to a target location and update ownership status\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object ?target - location)\n    :precondition (and (possessed ?item ?agent) (at ?agent ?target))\n    :effect (and (attached ?item ?target) (not (possessed ?item ?agent)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?agent`, `?item`, and `?target` to increase applicability across various scenarios where an entity (`?agent`) attaches an object (`?item`) to a location or another entity (`?target`).\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - Preconditions ensure that the `?item` is possessed by the `?agent` and the `?agent` is at the `?target` location.\n   - The effect reflects the change in state by marking the `?item` as attached to the `?target` and removing it from the possession of the `?agent`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - The merged action is streamlined to include only necessary conditions and effects, avoiding redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The action maintains consistent logic by providing clear preconditions and effects that make sense across different contexts where attaching might be relevant.\n\nThis universal action can now be adapted to various scenarios involving attachment tasks while maintaining a logical structure that reflects the changes in state.",
    "Based on the given guidelines, the merged action for the \"clean\" tasks should:\n\n1. Ensure generality by using abstract parameters.\n2. Clearly describe the state change through preconditions and effects.\n3. Retain core logic without unnecessary complexity.\n4. Avoid redundancy and ensure simplicity and efficiency.\n5. Maintain logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action for \"clean\":\n\n```lisp\n(:action clean\n    ; Clean a specified target and update its state\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?tool - object ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and (available ?agent) (attached ?tool ?agent) (dirty ?target))\n    :effect (and (clean ?target) (not (dirty ?target)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?agent`, `?tool`, and `?target` to be adaptable to a variety of cleaning tasks.\n- **State Change**: Preconditions ensure the agent is available, the tool is attached, and the target is dirty. The effects specify that the target becomes clean and is no longer dirty.\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic of ensuring the agent and tool are ready for the task and the target is dirty is retained.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action merges similar effects (cleaning a target) efficiently.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to various cleaning scenarios involving different agents, tools, and targets while maintaining simplicity and efficiency."

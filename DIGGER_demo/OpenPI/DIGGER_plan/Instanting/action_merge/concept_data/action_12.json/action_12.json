    "To merge the given actions under the \"obtain\" action name while maintaining generality, capturing state changes, avoiding redundancy, and ensuring logical consistency, we can create a universal action that abstracts the specific details of obtaining items or replacing components. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action obtain ; Obtain a resource or replace a component\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?resource - entity ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) \n                     (or (available ?resource) \n                         (and (requires_replacement ?resource) (condition_met ?resource))))\n  :effect (and (or (inventory ?agent ?resource) \n                   (replaced ?resource))\n               (not (available ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?agent`, `?resource`, and `?location` to cover a wide range of scenarios where an agent (e.g., a player) interacts with a resource or component at a specific location.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions describe the state before the action: the agent must be at the location, and either the resource is available, or it requires replacement with a condition met (e.g., rust dissolved).\n   - Effects describe the state after the action: the agent either obtains the resource into their inventory, or the resource is marked as replaced, indicating a successful transformation.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy by using the `or` construct to represent both obtaining a resource and replacing a component within the same framework.\n   - The `available` predicate is uniformly used to denote the availability of a resource for obtaining, while `condition_met` is used for conditions like rust being dissolved, simplifying the logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects by ensuring that the required states (availability or condition met) are checked before the action can occur, maintaining logical consistency across different contexts. \n\nThis universal action can now be applied to a variety of tasks where an agent interacts with resources or components, adapting to different scenarios by adjusting the abstract parameters.",
    "(:action pour ;  Perform an action involving pouring and updating the state of objects\n:parameters (?p - player ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?location - location)\n:precondition (and (at ?p ?location) (inventory ?p ?item1) (at ?item2 ?location))\n:effect (and (not (inventory ?p ?item1)) (on ?item1 ?item2))\n)\n\n(:action clean ;  Perform an action involving cleaning and updating the state of objects\n:parameters (?p - player ?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?location - location)\n:precondition (and (at ?p ?location) (inventory ?p ?item1) (on ?item2 ?location))\n:effect (and (not (on ?item2 ?location)) (on ?item2 ?item1) (clean ?location))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged actions use abstract parameters (?p - player, ?item1 - object, ?item2 - object, ?location - location) to ensure they can be applied to various tasks involving pouring and cleaning.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state, gradually transforming the entities' states until the goal is reached.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged actions avoid redundancy by combining similar effects and removing unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring that the actions are reasonable and applicable across different contexts.",
    "(:action dissolve ; Dissolve a substance from an object\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?object - object ?substance - dissolvent)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?object) (on ?substance ?object))\n  :effect (and (dissolved ?object) (not (on ?substance ?object)))\n)"

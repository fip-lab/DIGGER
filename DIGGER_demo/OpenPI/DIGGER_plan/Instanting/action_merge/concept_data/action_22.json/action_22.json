    "To merge the given actions into a universal action called \"fold,\" we need to ensure that it captures the essence of the folding process while maintaining applicability across different tasks. Let's create a merged action that embodies these principles:\n\n### Merged Action: Fold\n\n```pddl\n(:action fold\n    :parameters (?entity - object)\n    :precondition (and (not (completely-folded ?entity)))\n    :effect (and (completely-folded ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters, such as `?entity - object`, to ensure it can be applied to a variety of tasks, not just specific to towels or any specific item.\n  \n- **State Change:** The action clearly describes the transformation of the entity's state from \"not completely folded\" to \"completely folded,\" capturing the essence of the folding process in a generic manner.\n\n- **Simplicity:** The action is concise, avoiding unnecessary complexity and redundancy by focusing on the core logic of folding.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring the precondition checks if the entity is not already completely folded before allowing the effect of folding it completely, which is reasonable across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to any context where an object needs to be folded, making it a versatile and universal solution.",
    "Based on your provided guidelines and examples, here is the merged action for the \"store\" task:\n\n```lisp\n(:action store ; Store an item in a specified location\n    :parameters (?item - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?item) (storage_area ?location))\n    :effect (and (stored ?item ?location) (not (prepared ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action `store` uses abstract parameters `?item` (object) and `?location` (place), making it adaptable to different types of items and storage areas.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. An item that is `prepared` (folded, packaged, etc.) is stored in a `storage_area`, and it is no longer in the `prepared` state.\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained. The item needs to be in a certain state (`prepared`), and the location must be suitable for storage (`storage_area`). The effect updates the item's state to `stored` and removes its `prepared` state.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: By using abstract parameters and combining similar actions, redundancy is minimized, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the merged action is clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action `store` can be applied to various scenarios involving different types of items and storage locations while maintaining simplicity and efficiency in the PDDL representation.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal action named \"hang,\" we need to abstract the parameters and streamline the logic while maintaining the generality, state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's how the merged action would look based on the provided tasks:\n\n```pddl\n(:action hang\n    :parameters (?item - object ?destination - location ?intermediate - location)\n    :precondition (and (stored ?item ?intermediate) (suitable ?destination))\n    :effect (and (hung ?item ?destination) (not (stored ?item ?intermediate)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action \"hang\" is designed to be adaptable to various scenarios where an object needs to be moved from an intermediate storage location to a final destination.\n   - The parameters `?item`, `?destination`, and `?intermediate` are abstract, allowing the action to be applied to different contexts beyond towels and racks.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The precondition requires that the item is stored in an intermediate location and that the destination is suitable (e.g., a towel rack or any appropriate final spot).\n   - The effect reflects the change in state: the item is now hung at the destination, and it is no longer stored in the intermediate location.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - By merging similar effects (e.g., moving and changing states), the action is simplified and avoids redundancy.\n   - Unnecessary details from the original, specific actions are omitted to keep the universal action efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different tasks, ensuring that the action remains applicable and reasonable in various contexts."

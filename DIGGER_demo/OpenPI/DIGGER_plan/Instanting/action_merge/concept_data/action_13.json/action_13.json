    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, the merged action should be designed to handle various types of tasks related to catching, finding, or selecting items. Here's a universal action that combines the given actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action catch\n  ; Perform an action to capture, find, or select an item\n  :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (or (in_wild ?item) (at ?p ?loc) (owned ?p))\n                  (not (or (in_bag ?item) (bag_selected ?item))))\n  :effect (and \n           (or (caught ?item) (in_bag ?item) (bag_selected ?item))\n           (or (owned ?item) (not (in_wild ?item)) (not (at ?item ?loc))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?p - player`, `?item - object`, `?loc - location`) to cover a wide range of tasks related to catching, finding, or selecting items.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly outline the transitions in the entity's state. The action considers if the item is in the wild, at a location, or if the player owns it, and updates the state accordingly.\n- **Simplicity**: The action consolidates similar effects into a single action, avoiding redundancy while ensuring each task's goal is met.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency, ensuring that the action can be applied in different scenarios without conflicting with the core logic.\n\nThis merged action should efficiently handle various tasks, maintaining clarity and adaptability across multiple contexts.",
    "(:action use ; Use an item or resource to achieve an effect\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?target - entity ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (owned ?target) (in_inventory ?item) (inventory_selected ?agent))\n  :effect (and (effect_applied ?target) (not (in_inventory ?item)))\n)",
    "To create a merged action named \"wait\" that encompasses the essence of the provided action, we need to abstract the parameters and ensure that the preconditions and effects describe a general state change applicable to a variety of tasks. Here's how this can be done:\n\n```pddl\n(:action wait\n    :parameters (?entity - object)\n    :precondition (and (in_transition ?entity))\n    :effect (and (completed_transition ?entity) (not (in_transition ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameter `?entity` is abstract and can represent any object undergoing a transition, not limited to a specific type like `?v - vulpix`.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The precondition `(in_transition ?entity)` reflects that the entity is in the process of transitioning.\n   - The effect `(completed_transition ?entity)` indicates that the entity has completed its transition, while `(not (in_transition ?entity))` ensures the transition state is cleared.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: \n   - The core logic of transitioning from one state to another is retained with minimal complexity.\n   \n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: \n   - Using abstract parameters and a generic state transition avoids redundancy and keeps the action simple.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The logic maintains consistency by clearly defining the transition from an \"in progress\" state to a \"completed\" state for any entity type.\n\nThis merged action can be applied to various scenarios where an entity is expected to wait until a transition or process is complete."

Preconditions ensure that the ingredients are in the player's inventory and the blender is empty. Effects move the ingredients into the blender.\n- **blend_into_texture**: This action blends the ingredients into a smooth texture. Preconditions check that the ingredients are in the blender and the blender is off. Effects turn the blender on and make the mixture smooth.\n- **add-rum-and-blend**: This action adds rum to the blender and blends again. Preconditions ensure the player has rum, the mixture is smooth, and the blender is off. Effects add rum to the blender, make it alcoholic, and turn the blender on.\n- **pour-into-glass**: This action pours the smoothie into a glass. Preconditions check that the mixture is smooth, the blender is off, and the glass is empty. Effects pour the smoothie into the glass and empty the blender.\n- **garnish-glass**: This action garnishes the glass with a strawberry. Preconditions ensure the glass contains the smoothie and the player has a strawberry. Effects garnish the glass and remove the strawberry from the inventory.\n\nThese actions follow the structure and logic provided in the example to capture the steps of making a Banana Strawberry Rum Smoothie."

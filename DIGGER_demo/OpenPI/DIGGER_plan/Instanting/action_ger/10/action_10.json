    "Sure, let's generate the PDDL actions based on the provided task and steps.\n\nTask: Get on a Bike\n\nSteps:\n1. swing-leg-over-bike bike\n2. put_foot_on_pedal you pedals\n3. hold_handbrakes bike\n4. pedal-with-feet you\n5. stop you bike\n\nDescriptions:\n- To get on the bike, swing your non-dominant leg over the shaft of the bike.\n- Put your dominant foot on the pedal.\n- Hold on to the handlebars for support and to keep the bike straight.\n- Keeping your weight center and even, pedal with your feet.\n- Stopping.\n\nEntity State:\n- bike: {'location': {'before': \"beside person's body | absent\", 'after': \"now between person's legs | present\"}, 'stability': {'before': 'unstable', 'after': 'stable'}, 'weight': {'before': 'lighter', 'after': 'heavier'}, 'stability': {'before': 'unbalanced', 'after': 'balanced'}, 'orientation': {'before': 'crooked', 'after': 'straight'}, 'movement': {'before': 'still', 'after': 'moving'}, 'stability': {'before': 'stationary', 'after': 'in motion'}, 'stability': {'before': 'in motion | moving', 'after': 'stopped | stationary'}}\n- you: {'focus': {'before': 'focused on making bracelet', 'after': 'admiring bracelet'}}\n- pedals: {'location': {'before': 'on ground', 'after': 'in air'}, 'location': {'before': 'in air | on ground', 'after': 'on pedal'}, 'placement': {'before': 'on ground', 'after': 'now off ground'}, 'location': {'before': 'on ground', 'after': 'on pedal'}, 'motion': {'before': 'still', 'after': 'moving'}, 'location': {'before': 'on bike', 'after': 'on ground'}, 'placement': {'before': 'on pedal', 'after': 'now on ground'}}\n\nBased on these steps and descriptions, here are the PDDL actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action swing-leg-over-bike\n    :parameters (?p - person ?b - bike)\n    :precondition (and (beside ?b ?p) (not (between-legs ?b ?p)))\n    :effect (and (between-legs ?b ?p) (not (beside ?b ?p)))\n)\n\n(:action put_foot_on_pedal\n    :parameters (?p - person ?pedal - pedal)\n    :precondition (and (between-legs ?b ?p) (on-ground ?pedal))\n    :effect (and (on-pedal ?pedal ?p) (not (on-ground ?pedal)))\n)\n\n(:action hold_handbrakes\n    :parameters (?p - person ?b - bike)\n    :precondition (and (between-legs ?b ?p) (not (holding-handbrakes ?p ?b)))\n    :effect (holding-handbrakes ?p ?b)\n)\n\n(:action pedal-with-feet\n    :parameters (?p - person ?b - bike)\n    :precondition (and (between-legs ?b ?p) (holding-handbrakes ?p ?b) (on-pedal ?pedal ?p))\n    :effect (and (moving ?b) (not (stationary ?b)))\n)\n\n(:action stop\n    :parameters (?p - person ?b - bike)\n    :precondition (moving ?b)\n    :effect (and (stopped ?b) (not (moving ?b)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **swing-leg-over-bike**: The person swings their leg over the bike, changing the bike's location from beside the person to between their legs.\n2. **put_foot_on_pedal**: The person places their foot on the pedal, changing the pedal's location from on the ground to on the pedal.\n3. **hold_handbrakes**: The person holds the handbrakes for support, ensuring the bike remains stable.\n4. **pedal-with-feet**: The person starts pedaling, causing the bike to move.\n5. **stop**: The person stops the bike, changing its state from moving to stopped.\n\nThese actions capture the logical steps and conditions needed for each part of the task \"Get on a Bike\"."

Second, it must be a reasonably stiff item. Third, it should be somewhere between 15 and 20 cm (6-8 inches) long; the experiment can be performed otherwise, but read on, and you will see why this size is optimal. There are lots of other items that fit these criteria including Otter Pops, celery, and churros.

    "Here is the merged action for the \"drink\" task that adheres to the given guidelines:\n\n```lisp\n(:action drink ; Consume a liquid resource to satisfy a need\n :parameters (?npc - person ?liquid_source - liquid)\n :precondition (and (needs_hydration ?npc) (contains_drinkable ?liquid_source))\n :effect (and (not (needs_hydration ?npc)) (consumed ?liquid_source))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action is generalized to \"drink\" rather than specifically \"drink_water,\" allowing it to apply to various liquid sources or needs beyond just water.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition that the person is \"thirsty\" is generalized to \"needs_hydration,\" and the liquid source is generalized from \"water\" to \"liquid,\" reflecting a broader range of possible scenarios. The effect captures the state change from needing hydration to not needing it and marks the liquid source as consumed.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is streamlined to remove unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core logic of hydration and resource consumption.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring the action can be applied to various scenarios involving drinking or hydration needs.",
    "To merge the provided action into a single universal action named \"collect,\" we will focus on creating a general action applicable to different collection tasks. We will ensure the action captures the essence of collecting resources and updating the state of involved objects. Here's how the merged action can be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect ; Collect a resource and update the status of the container\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?resource - object ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and (available ?npc) (collectible ?resource) (empty ?container))\n  :effect (and (contains ?container ?resource) (not (empty ?container)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is generalized to apply to any scenario where a person (`?npc`) collects a resource (`?resource`) into a container (`?container`). The parameters are abstract enough to cover various collection tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures that the `?npc` is available, the `?resource` is collectible, and the `?container` is empty before the action can be performed.\n   - The effect states that the container will contain the resource, and it will no longer be empty, reflecting the change in the state of the container.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n   - The action removes redundancy by focusing on the essential elements of a collection task.\n   - The precondition and effect are straightforward, ensuring clarity and efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring valid preconditions must be met before the effects are enacted, making it applicable across multiple contexts where resources need to be collected and stored.",
    "(:action create_resource\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?location - place ?resource - object ?condition - condition)\n    :precondition (and \n        (has_materials ?npc ?resource) \n        (at_location ?npc ?location)\n        (meets_condition ?location ?condition)\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (resource_created ?npc ?resource) \n        (ready_for_next_step ?npc ?resource)\n    )\n)\n\n### Descriptions:\n\n1. **drink_water**: The action of drinking water to alleviate thirst.\n   - **Parameters**: A person (`?npc`) and a water source (`?water_source`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person is thirsty and the water source contains drinkable water.\n   - **Effects**: The person is no longer thirsty, and the water source is consumed.\n\n2. **collect_rain_water**: The action of collecting rainwater using leaves and bamboo.\n   - **Parameters**: A person (`?npc`), a large leaf (`?leaf`), a bamboo stalk (`?bamboo`), and a container (`?container`).\n   - **Preconditions**: It is raining in the jungle, there is a large leaf and bamboo stalk available, and the container is empty.\n   - **Effects**: The container now contains water.\n\n3. **create_fire**: The action of creating a fire to boil water.\n   - **Parameters**: A person (`?npc`) and the jungle (`?jungle`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person has materials for making a fire and is in the jungle.\n   - **Effects**: A fire is created, making the person ready to boil water.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action `create_resource` uses abstract parameters (`?npc`, `?location`, `?resource`, `?condition`) to adapt to various tasks, making it applicable to different contexts involving creation.\n- **State Change**: Preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change, from having materials and being in the right location/condition to creating the resource and being ready for the next step.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simplified by merging similar effects (resource creation) and avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are maintained consistently, ensuring the action logically progresses through different stages of resource creation."

This is an abstract precondition to cover various abilities required for different tasks.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(structure_exists ?location)`: A structure is created or exists at the location.\n  - `(not (available ?resource))`: The resource is no longer available after the action.\n  - `(performed ?npc ?location)`: The entity has performed the action at the location.\n\nThis merged action is designed to be general, adaptable, and efficient, maintaining logical consistency across different contexts while avoiding redundancy.",
    "Certainly! To merge PDDL actions into a single universal action, we'll follow the guidelines you provided. We'll take the `swim` action as an example to merge with other potential actions, ensuring it maintains generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nLet's start by considering the universal action, `transform_state`, which can encompass various state changes like swimming, checking, and listening to secrets. This universal action should abstractly capture the essence of the tasks while keeping it adaptable:\n\n### Universal Action: `transform_state`\n\n```lisp\n(:action transform_state\n    :parameters (?entity - agent ?target - object ?location - place ?task - task_type)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (available ?entity)\n                    (not (completed ?task ?entity ?target))\n                    (can_perform ?entity ?task)\n                    (at ?entity ?location))\n    :effect (and \n            (completed ?task ?entity ?target)\n            (at ?entity ?new_location))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted (`?entity`, `?target`, `?location`, `?task`) to apply to multiple tasks. The `agent` type can represent different entities like a character, player, or NPC.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state:\n   - `available ?entity`: The entity must be available.\n   - `not (completed ?task ?entity ?target)`: The task should not be already completed by the entity for the target.\n   - `can_perform ?entity ?task`: The entity must be capable of performing the task.\n   - `at ?entity ?location`: The entity must be at the specified location.\n   - `completed ?task ?entity ?target`: The task is completed by the entity for the target.\n   - `at ?entity ?new_location`: The entity moves to a new location if necessary.\n3. **Simplicity**: By abstracting the action and merging similar effects, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects logically align with the potential variety of tasks and ensure the action's applicability in different contexts.\n\n### Example Tasks Merged:\n1. **Checking a Bestseller List**:\n    - **Task**: Check a resource and update task status.\n    - **Entity**: `?npc`\n    - **Target**: `?book`\n    - **Location**: `library`\n    - **Task Type**: `check`\n\n2. **Listening to Member Secret**:\n    - **Task**: Assign a member to keep track of loans.\n    - **Entity**: `?leader`\n    - **Target**: `?member`\n    - **Location**: `book_club`\n    - **Task Type**: `assign_tracker`\n\n3. **Swimming**:\n    - **Task**: Move to a water location.\n    - **Entity**: `?npc`\n    - **Target**: `water`\n    - **Location**: `shore`\n    - **Task Type**: `swim`\n\nBy using the `transform_state` action, we can handle a variety of tasks with a single, universal action definition. This ensures adaptability, clarity in state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency across different tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, adaptable action, we will abstract the parameters and ensure the core logic of the preconditions and effects is maintained while keeping the action general and simple. Here's the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```pddl\n(:action get ; Get a resource and update possession status\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?source - location ?resource - item)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?actor ?source)\n                    (contains ?source ?resource)\n                    (accessible ?resource))\n    :effect (and\n              (have ?actor ?resource)\n              (not (contains ?source ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Action Name:** `get`\n  - The action is named \"get\" to reflect its generality and applicability to any task involving obtaining a resource.\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `?actor - entity`: The entity (could be a person, NPC, or any agent) performing the action.\n  - `?source - location`: The location or source from which the resource is being obtained.\n  - `?resource - item`: The item or resource that is being collected.\n\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - `(at ?actor ?source)`: The actor must be at the source location to perform the action.\n  - `(contains ?source ?resource)`: The source must contain the resource.\n  - `(accessible ?resource)`: The resource must be accessible, ensuring it can be acquired.\n\n- **Effects:**\n  - `(have ?actor ?resource)`: After the action, the actor will have the resource.\n  - `(not (contains ?source ?resource))`: The resource is no longer in the source, indicating it has been collected.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of obtaining a resource, ensuring that it can be applied to various tasks beyond just collecting water. The abstraction of parameters and conditions allows it to be used in different contexts while maintaining logical consistency and efficiency.",
    "Based on the given actions that involve checking, modifying, or transforming the state of an entity, we can create a single universal action that adapts to a variety of tasks with abstract parameters.

    "Sure! I will merge the given actions for you into a single universal action named \"put\".

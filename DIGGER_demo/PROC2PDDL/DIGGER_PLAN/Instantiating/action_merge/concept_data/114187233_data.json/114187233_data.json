    "The merged PDDL action for the task of peeling and processing a coconut, including draining and removing meat, can be synthesized by combining the various preconditions and effects into a cohesive universal action. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action process_coconut\n    :parameters (?p - person ?c - coconut ?t - tool ?r - rack ?g - glass)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (available ?p)\n                    (or (wrapped ?c) (has_casing ?c) (on ?c ?r) (not (drained ?c)) (broken ?c))\n                    (or (knife ?t) (sharp ?t) (tool ?t))\n                    (or (empty ?g) (not (empty ?g)))\n                  )\n    :effect (and \n              (or (peeled ?c) (not (wrapped ?c)) \n                  (exposed_shell ?c) (not (has_casing ?c))\n                  (drained ?c) (full ?g) \n                  (meat_extracted ?c) (empty_shell ?c))\n              (or (not (peeled ?c)) (not (broken ?c)))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Breakdown:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is named `process_coconut` to reflect a broad applicability to the task of processing the coconut, covering peeling, draining, and extracting meat.\n   - Parameters are abstracted to include a person (`?p`), a coconut (`?c`), a tool (`?t`), a rack (`?r`), and a glass (`?g`), making it adaptable to different tasks involving these objects.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions include various states the coconut can be in (wrapped, has casing, on rack, not drained, broken).\n   - Effects cover the outcomes of these states (peeled, exposed shell, drained, meat extracted, empty shell).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundancies are removed by merging similar conditions and effects.\n   - The action covers all necessary steps in a logical sequence, ensuring efficiency and simplicity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent across different states the coconut may be in, ensuring the action can be applied logically in various contexts.\n   - Ensures reasonable state transitions without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis merged action captures the essential steps required to process a coconut, from peeling to draining and extracting meat, while maintaining adaptability, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "Given the actions that need to be merged, the objective is to create a generalized and efficient merged action named \"wrap\". Below is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action wrap\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?wrapper - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (not (wrapped ?item))\n                  (clean ?wrapper)\n                )\n  :effect (and\n            (wrapped ?item ?wrapper)\n            (not (clean ?wrapper))\n            (dirty ?wrapper)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n    - The merged action uses abstract parameters (?p - person, ?item - object, ?wrapper - object) to apply to a variety of tasks that involve wrapping any item with any wrapper.\n    - This allows the action to be adaptable and not limited to specific types of actions or objects.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - Preconditions clearly state that the item must not already be wrapped and the wrapper must be clean.\n    - Effects clearly reflect the transformation: the item becomes wrapped, and the wrapper transitions from clean to dirty.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar actions into a single action.\n    - Parameters and conditions are generalized to maintain simplicity and efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain consistent logic across different tasks.\n    - The action ensures that the wrapping process is logically sound and applicable to various contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"wrap\" can now be used for different scenarios involving wrapping items, maintaining the core logic and ensuring efficiency and simplicity.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action called `break`, we need to combine the common elements and ensure that the resulting action is abstract and adaptable to various contexts. Here's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action break ; Break an object and update its state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?obj - object ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (not (broken ?obj))\n                  (in_hand ?tool)\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (broken ?obj)\n            (not (wrapped ?obj))\n            (not (peeled ?obj))\n            (not (drained ?obj))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action `break` applies to any `object` that can be broken using a `tool` held by a `person`.\n   - The parameters are abstract: `?p` for person, `?obj` for object, and `?tool` for tool.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the object is not already broken and the tool is in hand.\n   - Effects update the state of the object to `broken` and remove other specific states like `wrapped`, `peeled`, and `drained`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action is simple and removes redundancy by combining similar state changes into one action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and applicable to various scenarios involving breaking objects.\n\nThis merged action `break` captures the essence of the provided actions and combines their logic into a single, abstract, and efficient action."

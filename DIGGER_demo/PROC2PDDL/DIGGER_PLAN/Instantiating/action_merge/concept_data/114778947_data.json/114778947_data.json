    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"push,\" we need to ensure that the action is generic, captures the state change clearly, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and is logically consistent. Let's proceed with these considerations:\n\n### Action Name After Merge: push\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action push\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?target - object ?tool - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n        (has_tool ?agent ?tool)\n        (locked ?target)\n        (intact_state ?target)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (tool_applied ?tool ?target)\n        (not (intact_state ?target))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - **Parameters**: The parameters are abstract (`?agent`, `?target`, `?tool`) to cover a wide range of scenarios, not just specific to cars or hangers.\n   - **Resource**: The term `?tool` is used instead of `?hanger` to generalize the type of tool being used.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: Requires the agent to have the tool and the target to be locked and in an intact state, reflecting a state that needs change.\n   - **Effects**: Reflects the change in the target's state by having the tool applied and changing the `intact_state` to a non-intact state.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The action retains the logic of using a tool to change the state of a target object, central to both actions being merged.\n   - It captures the essence of using a tool to apply some form of interaction or manipulation.\n\n4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - Combined similar effects (e.g., from `hanger_inside_door` and `not intact_weather_stripping`) into a more generic `tool_applied` effect.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable in various contexts where an agent uses a tool to modify a target object.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible template that can be adapted to different scenarios by substituting specific entities, objects, and resources while maintaining the core functionality of the original actions.",
    "Let's merge the provided actions related to \"hook\" into a single universal action.\n\n### Actions to be Merged:\n1. **hook_latch**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action hook_latch\n        :parameters (?npc - agent ?car - vehicle ?hanger - tool)\n        :precondition (and\n          (hanger_inside_door ?hanger ?car)\n          (has_tool ?npc ?hanger)\n          (locked ?car)\n        )\n        :effect (and\n          (unlocked ?car)\n          (not (locked ?car))\n        )\n      )\n    ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action hook ; Universal action to hook and manipulate objects\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and\n    (has_tool ?npc ?tool)\n    (not (manipulated ?item))  ; Abstract precondition to ensure item is not already manipulated\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (manipulated ?item)  ; Abstract effect to indicate the item has been manipulated\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters (?npc, ?item, ?tool) to ensure broad applicability.\n- **State Change:** The precondition checks if the agent has the tool and if the item has not been manipulated yet. The effect updates the state to indicate that the item has been manipulated.\n- **Simplicity:** Redundant conditions and effects are removed to keep the action simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different tasks.\n\nThe merged action \"hook\" can now be used in various contexts where an agent manipulates an object using a tool.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, more abstract and universal action while maintaining the guidelines provided, we need to focus on generality, logical consistency, and simplicity. The merged action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving state changes, such as checking, modifying, or creating.\n\n### Merged Action: Straighten\n\n```pddl\n(:action straighten ; Straighten an object to modify its state\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?object - tool)\n  :precondition (and\n    (has_tool ?npc ?object)\n    (not (straight ?object))\n    (modifiable ?object)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (straight ?object)\n    (not (hooked ?object))\n    (state_transformed ?object)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstract (?npc for any agent, ?object for any tool or item), making the action applicable to a wide variety of tasks that involve straightening or modifying objects.\n   - The action is not limited to coat hangers; it can apply to any tool or object that requires modification.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks that the tool is not already straight and is modifiable, reflecting the need for transformation.\n   - The effect indicates the object becomes straight and changes state, ensuring a clear transformation occurs.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Retains the logic of requiring the tool to be in possession of the agent (?npc) and that the object is initially not straight.\n   - The effects reflect the new state post-action, ensuring consistency.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Merges similar effects (e.g., straightening and unhooking) to create a single, efficient action.\n   - Removes specifics related to only coat hangers, broadening the scope.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are designed to be reasonable in different contexts, ensuring that the logic applies universally to tasks involving similar state changes.\n\nThis merged action \"straighten\" is now a universal action that can be used in a variety of contexts where an object's state is transformed through straightening or similar modifications.",
    "Given the guidelines and the provided example actions, here is the merged action for `SlideIntoSideOfDoor`:\n\n```pddl\n(:action SlideIntoSideOfDoor\n    :parameters (?u - user ?c - creditcard ?l - lock)\n    :precondition (and\n            (userHasCreditCard ?u ?c)\n            (lockInDoor ?l)\n            (creditCardInHand ?u ?c)\n            (doorLocked ?l)\n            )\n    :effect (and\n                (creditCardInDoorFrame ?c ?l)\n                (not (creditCardInHand ?u ?c))\n                (doorUnlocked ?l)\n                (not (doorLocked ?l))\n                )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Action Name**: `SlideIntoSideOfDoor` - This action is named after the technique of sliding a credit card into the side of a door to unlock it.\n  \n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?u - user`: Represents the person performing the action.\n  - `?c - creditcard`: Represents the credit card used to unlock the door.\n  - `?l - lock`: Represents the lock on the door that is being manipulated.\n\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(userHasCreditCard ?u ?c)`: Ensures that the user has possession of the credit card.\n  - `(lockInDoor ?l)`: Ensures that the lock is part of the door.\n  - `(creditCardInHand ?u ?c)`: Ensures that the user is currently holding the credit card.\n  - `(doorLocked ?l)`: Ensures that the door is locked before the action is performed.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(creditCardInDoorFrame ?c ?l)`: The credit card is now placed in the door frame, indicating the action of sliding it into the door.\n  - `(not (creditCardInHand ?u ?c))`: The user no longer holds the credit card, as it is now in the door frame.\n  - `(doorUnlocked ?l)`: The door becomes unlocked as a result of the action.\n  - `(not (doorLocked ?l))`: The door is no longer locked.\n\nThis merged action effectively combines the logic of the actions related to using a credit card to unlock a door, ensuring that it is both general and adaptable to similar tasks. The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the state changes involved in the process."

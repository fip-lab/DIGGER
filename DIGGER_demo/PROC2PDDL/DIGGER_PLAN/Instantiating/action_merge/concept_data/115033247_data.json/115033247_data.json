    "To create a merged action named \"peel\" that is applicable to a variety of tasks involving peeling or removing an outer layer, we will combine the given actions while adhering to the guidelines. Here\u2019s how the merged action can be defined:\n\n```pddl\n(:action peel\n  ; Peel an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (not (peeled ?item)) (has-tool ?agent))\n  :effect (and (peeled ?item) (not (outer-layer ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are defined as `?agent - entity` and `?item - object` to increase the applicability of the action across different tasks, not limited to specific items like papyrus strips.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks that the item is not already peeled and that the agent has the necessary tool to perform the peeling.\n   - The effect reflects the change in state, marking the item as peeled and indicating the removal of its outer layer.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is streamlined to focus on the core logic of peeling, removing unnecessary complexity by generalizing the parameters and effects.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different contexts where peeling or a similar transformation is required.\n\nThis action is adaptable to various scenarios where an entity uses a tool to peel or remove an outer layer from an object, encompassing a broader range of tasks beyond the initial examples.",
    "Based on the provided actions and the guidelines for merging them into a single universal action, we can create a generalized \"buy\" action that captures the essence of both buying and preparing a resource. The merged action will be adaptable to various scenarios, involving checking, modifying, or creating states of different entities. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action buy ; Purchase or prepare a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (not (obtained ?resource)) \n                     (or (has-money ?npc) (has-tool ?npc)))\n  :effect (obtained ?resource))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action is designed to handle both the purchase and preparation of resources. It uses abstract parameters (`?npc` for the agent performing the action and `?resource` for the object being acted upon) to increase applicability across different tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the resource has not been obtained yet and that the agent has the necessary means to obtain it, whether through monetary means or tools.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy by combining the logic of obtaining resources through either buying (requiring money) or preparing (requiring tools) into a single effect: the resource being obtained.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different contexts. It checks if the resource is already obtained and requires either money or a tool to proceed, making it versatile for different scenarios.\n\nThis merged action is applicable to a wide range of tasks, such as buying or preparing various types of resources, by simply adjusting the specific parameters `?npc` and `?resource` to fit the context."

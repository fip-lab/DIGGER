    "To merge the given actions into a single universal \"defend\" action, we need to ensure that the resulting action captures the essence of defending against threats (e.g., sharks) while being adaptable to various scenarios involving defense. Here's how the merged action could look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action defend\n  :parameters (?entity - agent ?threat - object ?location - location ?vessel - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?entity ?vessel)\n                  (threat-present ?threat ?location)\n                  (aware-of-threat ?entity)\n                  (vessel_location ?vessel in_open_water)\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n           (defending ?entity ?vessel)\n           (not (threat-attacking ?entity))\n           (vessel_location ?vessel at_dock)\n           (vessel_stability ?vessel steadied)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - Abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?threat`, `?location`, `?vessel`) are used to ensure the action can apply to various scenarios, not just specific ones like \"shark\" or \"ship\".\n   - The term \"threat\" is used instead of \"shark\" to generalize the nature of the danger.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the entity is at a location with a threat present and that the entity is aware of the threat.\n   - The effects include the entity defending the vessel and the vessel being moved to a safe location.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The preconditions and effects from the given actions are retained to maintain the core logic of defending against a threat and stabilizing the situation.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Similar effects from different actions (like moving the vessel to safety) are merged to avoid redundancy.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains a consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring that it is applicable to various defense scenarios.\n\nThis merged action is designed to be adaptable to different contexts where an entity needs to defend against a threat, ensuring that the vessel's stability and location are secured.",
    "Based on your guidelines and the provided examples, here's the merged action for \"attack\":\n\nAction name after merge: `attack`\n\nMerged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action attack\n  ;; Attack a target and update the status\n  :parameters (?attacker - entity ?target - entity ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (engaged ?attacker ?target ?location)\n                  (threat_present ?target ?location)\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (threat_retreating ?target ?location)\n            (not (attacking ?target ?attacker))\n            (location_status ?target safe)\n            (motion_status ?target moving)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Generality:\n- Abstract parameters (e.g., `?attacker - entity`, `?target - entity`, `?location - location`) allow the action to be applied to various scenarios involving different types of entities and locations.\n\n#### State Change:\n- Preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the changes in state, such as retreating threats, updating the status of the location, and the motion status of the target.\n\n#### Core Logic:\n- The core logic of engaging an attacker, the presence of a threat, and the resulting state changes (e.g., threat retreating, target moving) are retained without unnecessary complexity.\n\n#### Avoid Redundancy:\n- Similar effects (e.g., threat retreating, updating location and motion status) are merged into single logical statements, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n\n#### Logical Consistency:\n- Preconditions and effects are consistent across different tasks, ensuring clear and reasonable logic.\n\nThis merged action should effectively cover various tasks related to attacking and defending in different contexts, maintaining the core logic and ensuring simplicity and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal PDDL action named \"make,\" we need to ensure that the merged action is general, maintains logical consistency, and captures the essence of both actions. Since the second action, \"Attack ship in the deep sea,\" is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical example to demonstrate the merging process. Here's how we can design the merged action:\n\n### Hypothetical Example of Action 2: \n```pddl\n(:action attack_ship\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?ship - vehicle)\n    :precondition (and\n                   (on_board ?agent ?ship)\n                   (not (damaged ?ship))\n                  )\n    :effect (damaged ?ship)\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action make ; Create or transform a state of an entity\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                   (available ?actor)\n                   (not (transformed ?target))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n             (transformed ?target)\n             (not (original_state ?target))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The merged action \"make\" uses abstract parameters `?actor` and `?target` to represent an agent and an object, increasing its applicability across different tasks, whether creating or transforming a state.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly indicate a transformation from an \"original_state\" to a \"transformed\" state. This abstraction captures the essence of both creating a horizontal bar and damaging a ship.\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:** The action is streamlined by focusing on the core logic of changing the state of `?target`. Redundancies such as specific location changes or context-specific conditions are removed.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains a logical flow with reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring that it can be applied to various scenarios where an entity's state is changed.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to diverse tasks requiring an entity's state transformation, aligning with the guidelines provided.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single, adaptable \"block\" action, we need to ensure that the action can be applied to various tasks while maintaining logical consistency, simplicity, and a clear state change. Here\u2019s how the merged action can be structured:\n\n### Merged Action: Block\n\n```lisp\n(:action block ; Block an entity to alter its state or deter its action\n :parameters (?entity - object ?obstacle - object ?zone - area)\n :precondition (and\n                (object_location ?obstacle in_zone ?zone)\n                (object_location ?entity in_different_zone ?zone)\n                (not (object_deterred ?entity))\n               )\n :effect (and\n          (object_location ?entity in_zone ?zone)\n          (object_deterred ?entity)\n         )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters are abstracted as `?entity`, `?obstacle`, and `?zone` to apply to a variety of situations beyond just blocking a path for a shark. This setup allows for blocking different types of entities using various obstacles within a specified area or zone.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the obstacle is properly located and the entity is not yet deterred.\n   - The effects describe moving the entity into the zone and marking it as deterred, reflecting a clear change in state.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - The essential preconditions and effects from the original action are retained, ensuring that the action logically transitions the system from the preconditions to the effects without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The merged action removes specific details that may not be applicable in all contexts, such as specific objects like `?npc`, `?shark`, and `?spear`, and instead uses more general terms.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains a consistent logic across different tasks by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear, adaptable to different scenarios where an entity needs to be blocked or deterred.\n\nThis universal \"block\" action can now be adapted to various contexts, whether blocking an animal, a person, or any other type of object, making it versatile and efficient for use in a range of tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"take,\" we will focus on creating a general action that can adapt to various contexts involving taking or interacting with entities. The merged action should encapsulate the core logic of the original actions while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency. Here is how the \"take\" action can be structured:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```pddl\n(:action take\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?target - entity ?tool - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (near ?target ?npc)\n                  (has_tool ?npc ?tool)\n                  (not (handled ?npc ?target))\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n           (handled ?npc ?target)\n           (target_condition ?target modified)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters (?npc, ?target, ?tool) to cover a wide range of tasks. This allows the action to be applied in various contexts where an agent interacts with an entity using a tool.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures that the target is near the NPC, the NPC possesses a tool, and the target hasn't been handled yet. \n   - The effect marks the target as handled and modifies its condition, reflecting the state change.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The action retains the logic of interaction by requiring proximity and possession of a tool, while ensuring the target's condition is altered as a result.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By using abstract parameters and effects, the action avoids redundancy. It merges similar actions by focusing on the essential elements of taking or interacting.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains consistent logic across different scenarios, ensuring preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable.\n\nThis merged \"take\" action is versatile and can be adapted for scenarios like taking a shot at a shark, using a spear, or interacting with other entities in different contexts."

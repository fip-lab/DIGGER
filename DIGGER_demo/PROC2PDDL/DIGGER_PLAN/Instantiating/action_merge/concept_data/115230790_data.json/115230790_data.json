    "To merge the given actions into a single, versatile PDDL action, we need to ensure that it can serve multiple purposes while maintaining logical consistency, simplicity, and generality. In your example, we have two actions related to movement and checking. Here's how you could define a merged \"move\" action:\n\n### Merged Action: Move\n\n```pddl\n(:action move ; Move an entity from one location to another and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - agent ?from - location ?to - location)\n  :precondition (and (not (moved ?entity ?from ?to))\n                     (at ?entity ?from)) ; Ensure the entity is currently at the 'from' location\n  :effect (and (moved ?entity ?from ?to)\n               (not (at ?entity ?from)) ; Update the entity's location\n               (at ?entity ?to)) ; Reflect the new location\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The `move` action uses abstract parameters such as `?entity`, `?from`, and `?to`, allowing it to adapt to various agents (NPCs, players, etc.) and locations. This makes it applicable to a wide range of movement-related tasks.\n  \n- **State Change:** The precondition ensures the entity is currently at the `from` location and hasn't yet moved to the `to` location. The effect clearly updates the entity's state by marking it as having moved and changing its location.\n\n- **Simplicity:** The action is straightforward, focusing only on the necessary state changes to indicate movement. It avoids additional complexity or redundant effects.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** Preconditions and effects are coherent and ensure logical transitions from one state to another. The logical state of the entity's location is consistently updated.\n\nThis merged action can serve as a universal action for moving entities between locations while keeping the state transitions clear and efficient.",
    "Based on the provided actions and the guidelines for merging them into a single universal action, the merged action will be as follows:\n\n### Merged Action: check\n\n```pddl\n(:action check ; Check a resource and update task status\n  :parameters (?npc - npc ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?npc) (not (checked ?npc ?item)))\n  :effect (checked ?npc ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The merged action `check` uses abstract parameters (`?npc` and `?item`) which can represent an NPC (non-player character) and a variety of items or objects. This makes the action applicable to multiple tasks.\n- **State Change:** The precondition ensures that the NPC is available and has not yet checked the specified item. The effect updates the state to indicate that the item has been checked by the NPC.\n- **Simplicity:** The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into a single, simple, and efficient action.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\n### Application to Provided Tasks:\n- **listen_to_astronomers:** This can be represented as `check` with `?item` being the location where astronomers are.\n- **check_supplies:** This can be represented as `check` with `?item` being the supplies.\n- **check_bunker:** This can be represented as `check` with `?item` being the bunker.\n- **check_weapons:** This can be represented as `check` with `?item` being the weapons and ammunition.\n\nBy using the merged `check` action, we can capture the essence of various checking tasks without needing separate actions for each specific case. This approach simplifies the PDDL model while preserving the core logic and ensuring adaptability to different contexts.",
    "The merged action for the given tasks, following the guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, would be:\n\n```lisp\n(:action wait ; Wait for a condition to be met and update the status\n :parameters (?entity - entity ?context - context)\n :precondition (and (in_context ?entity ?context) (not (condition_met ?entity ?context)))\n :effect (condition_met ?entity ?context))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?entity` and `?context` are abstract and flexible, allowing the action to apply to various entities (e.g., NPCs, objects) and contexts (e.g., bunkers, reports).\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks if the entity is within the context and if a specific condition has not been met. The effect marks the condition as met, reflecting a clear state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: By abstracting the parameters and focusing on the condition's met status, redundancy is minimized, and the action remains straightforward.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains a consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action can now be adapted to various scenarios where an entity needs to wait for a specific condition to be satisfied within a given context, such as waiting for reports or staying isolated in a bunker.",
    "(:action buy ; Purchase an item and update ownership status\n:parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object ?location - place)\n:precondition (and (in_location ?npc ?location) (not (owns ?npc ?item)))\n:effect (owns ?npc ?item))",
    "Sure, let's merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"outfit\". Here are the steps to achieve this, following the guidelines:\n\n1. **Generality**: Use abstract parameters to increase applicability.\n2. **State Change**: Reflect the state change in preconditions and effects.\n3. **Simplicity**: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Maintain consistent logic across different tasks.\n\nHere are the actions that need to be merged:\n\n1. **outfit_bunker_with_energy_source**\n2. **Stay in isolation**\n\n### Given Actions\n\n1. **outfit_bunker_with_energy_source**\n```pddl\n(:action outfit_bunker_with_energy_source\n  :parameters (?bunker - bunker ?npc - npc ?heat - heat)\n  :precondition (and (in_bunker ?npc ?bunker) (not (energy_source ?bunker ?heat)))\n  :effect (energy_source ?bunker ?heat)\n)\n```\n\n2. **Stay in isolation**\n```pddl\n(:action stay_in_isolation\n  :parameters (?npc - npc ?isolation_area - area)\n  :precondition (and (in_area ?npc ?isolation_area) (not (left_area ?npc ?isolation_area)))\n  :effect (in_isolation ?npc ?isolation_area)\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```pddl\n(:action outfit\n  :parameters (?npc - entity ?place - location ?resource - resource)\n  :precondition (and (in_location ?npc ?place) (not (equipped ?place ?resource)))\n  :effect (equipped ?place ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?npc - entity`, `?place - location`, and `?resource - resource` to be adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. The entity needs to be in the location, and the resource should not already be equipped in the location. The effect will be that the resource is now equipped in the location.\n3. **Simplicity**: By merging similar actions and abstracting the parameters, redundancy is avoided, making the action simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action, `outfit`, can be used in various scenarios where an entity needs to equip a resource in a location, for example:\n\n- Outfitting a bunker with an energy source.\n- Assigning an NPC to an isolation area with specific resources.\n- Equipping a place with any required resource for different tasks."

    "(:action make ; Create or modify a state by interacting with an object\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?location - place ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (available ?target))\n    :effect (and (modified ?target) (changed_state ?location))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `make` uses abstract parameters such as `?npc` for the entity performing the action, `?location` for the place where the action occurs, and `?target` for the object being modified. This ensures adaptability to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: Preconditions include `at ?npc ?location` and `available ?target`, reflecting the necessary conditions for the action. The effects `modified ?target` and `changed_state ?location` ensure that the action results in a clear state change.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions (e.g., making something wet, building a shelter) into a single, efficient action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain consistency across different contexts, ensuring that the action can be applied to various tasks without losing its core logic.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of creating or modifying a state by interacting with an object, making it versatile and effective for different scenarios.",
    "The actions for drinking water, eating fruit, and eating mushrooms can be merged into a single universal action called \"consume\". This action will be adaptable to different tasks involving the consumption of resources (be it water, fruit, or mushrooms). Below is the merged PDDL action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action consume ; Consume a resource and update entity status\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - consumable)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?npc)\n                    (not (consumed ?npc ?item))\n                    (is_consumable ?item)\n                    (safe_to_consume ?item)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (consumed ?npc ?item)\n              (not (available ?item))\n              (hydrated ?npc) ; if the item is water\n              (nourished ?npc) ; if the item is food\n              (not (location ?item ?source)) ; if the item was at a location like a bush or river\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action \"consume\" is designed to be abstract and can apply to various consumable items (water, fruit, mushrooms, etc.).\n   - Parameters are generalized as `?npc` for the agent and `?item` for the consumable resource.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the agent is available and the item is consumable and safe.\n   - Effects update the status to reflect the item has been consumed and the agent is hydrated or nourished depending on the item type.\n   - The item is no longer available at its previous location.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions and effects are avoided.\n   - The merged action encapsulates the core logic of the individual actions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are clearly defined to ensure logical consistency across different contexts.\n   - The action ensures the necessary conditions are met before performing the consumption and specifies the resulting changes.\n\nThis merged action is versatile and can be adapted for various scenarios involving the consumption of different resources, maintaining clarity and efficiency.",
    "To create a universal \"place\" action that merges the given actions while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract the parameters and unify the preconditions and effects as follows:\n\n### Merged Action: `place`\n\n```pddl\n(:action place ; Place an item and update the context state\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?location - place ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (present ?item) (not (placed ?item ?location)))\n  :effect (and (placed ?item ?location) (updated ?location))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters `?npc`, `?location`, and `?item` are abstract enough to represent a variety of tasks. `?npc` can be any agent, `?location` any place, and `?item` any object.\n   - This allows the action to be used in diverse scenarios, such as placing a branch on a west plain or any other object in any location.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the agent is at the specified location and the item is present.\n   - Effects clearly indicate that the item has been placed and the state of the location is updated (`updated ?location` can be further specified to reflect specific changes such as creation, noise increase, etc., based on the context).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by merging similar preconditions and effects into a single action, reducing complexity.\n   - Only essential conditions are retained, making the action efficient and straightforward.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring the necessary conditions (presence and location) are met before placing the item.\n   - The effect reflects a reasonable state change, marking the item as placed and indicating a context update.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"place\" is adaptable to multiple scenarios, maintaining its core logic while being applicable in various contexts.",
    "Given your requirements and the provided actions that need to be merged, here's the merged PDDL action for the \"get\" action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action get ; Get a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and\n    (or\n      (and (location ?npc ?source) (source_of ?source ?item))\n      (visible ?npc)\n    )\n    (not (collected ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (has ?npc ?item)\n    (not (location ?item ?source))\n    (not (visible ?npc))\n    (collected ?item)\n  )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The merged action uses abstract parameters `?npc` for the agent and `?item` for the object, making it adaptable to various tasks involving different resources.\n- **State Change:** The `precondition` and `effect` clauses clearly describe the state changes. The action checks if the agent is in the correct location or if the item is visible, and ensures the item hasn't been collected. The effects then update the state to reflect that the agent has the item, it's no longer at the source, it's not visible, and it's considered collected.\n- **Simplicity:** By combining similar conditions and effects, the merged action avoids redundancy and maintains simplicity.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The merged action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action should effectively capture the core logic of the provided actions while being versatile enough for various scenarios.",

It uses the abstract parameters `?npc` and `?item` to cover a wide range of scenarios.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly state the change in states. For `camouflage_helmet`, it involves making the NPC camouflaged and not visible. For `identify_mushrooms`, it involves identifying the mushroom.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity. The use of `or` conditions ensures that the merged action can handle different scenarios.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Actions with similar effects are merged to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts, ensuring clarity and consistency in logic.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal \"search\" action, we need to create a generalized structure that can be applied to various search-related tasks. We'll use abstract parameters and ensure logical consistency and simplicity. Here's how we can merge the provided actions:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```lisp\n(:action search ; Search for a resource and update discovery status\n    :parameters (?searcher - agent ?target - entity)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (trained ?searcher)\n                    (not (found ?searcher ?target))\n                  )\n    :effect (found ?searcher ?target)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action is named \"search\" and uses abstract parameters `?searcher` and `?target` instead of specific terms like `?npc` or specific targets like `mushrooms`. This allows the action to be applicable to a wide range of search tasks, whether it's searching for mushrooms, books, or other objects.\n\n- **State Change:** The precondition `(trained ?searcher)` ensures that the agent is capable of searching, and `(not (found ?searcher ?target))` checks that the target has not yet been discovered. The effect `(found ?searcher ?target)` signifies the successful discovery of the target.\n\n- **Simplicity:** The action removes any redundant or unnecessary complexity by merging the logic of searching and discovering into one straightforward action.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining a consistent logic that can be applied to different contexts where an agent searches for a target.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged \"search\" action achieves a balance of generality and specificity, making it a versatile tool for various search-related tasks."

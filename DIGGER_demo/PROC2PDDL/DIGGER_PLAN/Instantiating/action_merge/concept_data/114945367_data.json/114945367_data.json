    "To create a merged action that captures the essence of the \"collect\" tasks, we must ensure the action is general, captures the state change, and avoids redundancy. Here's how the merged action can be designed:\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect\n  ; Collect an item and prepare it for use\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?agent) (not (collected ?item)))\n  :effect (and (collected ?item) (prepared ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstract, using `?agent` to denote any actor (e.g., person, robot) and `?item` to represent any object (e.g., stick, book).\n   - The action can apply to a variety of tasks involving collection and preparation.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The action captures the transition from an uncollected to a collected state with the `collected` predicate.\n   - The additional `prepared` predicate indicates that the item is ready for the next step (akin to bundling or placing in formation).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant actions are avoided by combining collection and preparation, streamlining the process.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - Preconditions ensure the agent is available and the item is not yet collected.\n   - Effects reflect the change in state clearly, marking the item as collected and prepared.\n\nThis merged action effectively combines the essence of collecting, bundling, and preparing tasks into a single, adaptable action.",
    "To merge actions under the \"place\" category, we need to ensure that the resulting action is both general and adaptable to various contexts. The merged action should effectively manage the placement of items while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity. Let's proceed with the merging:\n\n### Original Actions to Merge:\n\n1. **Place Sticks in Formation:**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action place_sticks_in_formation\n       :parameters (?s - stick)\n       :precondition (bundled ?s)\n       :effect (in_formation ?s)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Build Shelter (hypothetical, assuming it involves placement):**\n   ```pddl\n   ;; Assume a hypothetical action that involves placing components to build a shelter\n   (:action build_shelter\n       :parameters (?component - object)\n       :precondition (available ?component)\n       :effect (part_of_shelter ?component)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action place\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?entity) (not (placed ?entity ?location)))\n    :effect (placed ?entity ?location)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action is designed to be applicable to various tasks involving the placement of entities (e.g., sticks, components) in different contexts (e.g., formations, shelters).\n   - Abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?location`) allow it to be adapted to different objects and locations.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition indicates that the entity must be \"prepared\" (bundled, available, etc.) before placement.\n   - The effect shows the entity being placed at a specific location, capturing the state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action avoids redundancy by using a single parameter set and condition for placement, simplifying the logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different tasks, ensuring clear and reasonable state transitions.\n\nThis merged action effectively combines the logic of placing sticks in formation and building a shelter, making it a versatile action for various placement tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal \"build\" action while maintaining generality, logical consistency, and simplicity, we can create an abstract action that encompasses the various processes involved in building different structures. Here's how the merged action could be structured:\n\n```lisp\n(:action build ; Universal build action\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?location - location ?structure - structure ?materials - set)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?npc)\n                    (has_materials ?npc ?materials)\n                    (not (built ?structure))\n                  )\n    :effect (built ?structure)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: \n  - The parameters are abstract and adaptable to a variety of tasks: `?npc` represents any non-player character involved, `?location` is the place where the building occurs (e.g., camp), `?structure` is any structure being built (e.g., shelter, teepee), and `?materials` is a set of materials required for building.\n  \n- **State Change**:\n  - The precondition `(available ?npc)` ensures the NPC is ready to build.\n  - The condition `(has_materials ?npc ?materials)` ensures the NPC has the necessary materials.\n  - The condition `(not (built ?structure))` ensures the structure is not already built.\n  - The effect `(built ?structure)` indicates the structure is successfully built once the action is executed.\n\n- **Simplicity**:\n  - Redundancy is avoided by using a single action that can apply to different types of structures and building scenarios.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**:\n  - The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts by requiring an NPC to have materials and ensuring a structure is not already built before proceeding with the construction.\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the essence of the original actions, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in various building tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal PDDL action named \"gather,\" we will create an action that generalizes the process of gathering any resource, whether it's water, tinder, or kindling. The merged action should use abstract parameters and follow the guidelines provided:\n\n### Merged Action: gather\n\n```lisp\n(:action gather\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?resource - resource ?area - area)\n  :precondition (and\n    (available ?resource)\n    (selected_area ?area)\n    (not (has ?npc ?resource))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (collected ?resource)\n    (has ?npc ?resource)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Action Name**: `gather`\n  - This name reflects the task of collecting any type of resource.\n\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?npc` is the non-player character (agent) involved in the action.\n  - `?resource` is the resource being gathered. This could be water, tinder, or kindling.\n  - `?area` is the area where the resource is being gathered from.\n\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(available ?resource)`: The resource must be available for collection.\n  - `(selected_area ?area)`: The area must be selected for gathering.\n  - `(not (has ?npc ?resource))`: The NPC should not already possess the resource.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(collected ?resource)`: The resource is now marked as collected.\n  - `(has ?npc ?resource)`: The NPC now possesses the resource.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Generality**: The action is designed to handle various resources by using abstract parameters. This allows it to apply to multiple tasks involving gathering.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly define the transition of the resource from being available to being in possession of the NPC.\n- **Simplicity**: By using generalized conditions and effects, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The logical flow of preconditions and effects is consistent with the task of gathering, ensuring clear and reasonable behavior across different contexts.",
    "Based on the guidelines provided and the example actions, the goal is to merge the actions into a universal \"search\" action that is adaptable, concise, and maintains logical consistency. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n### Action Name: `search`\n\n#### Merged Action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action search ; Search and gather resources or information\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?target - entity)\n  :precondition (and (not (searched ?agent ?target)))\n  :effect (searched ?agent ?target)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: \n  - The parameters `?agent` and `?target` are abstract, allowing this action to be applied to a wide range of tasks. An `agent` can be any entity capable of performing a search (e.g., a person, a robot), and a `target` can be any entity or resource to be searched (e.g., an area, an object).\n\n- **State Change**: \n  - The precondition ensures that the `target` has not been searched by the `agent` yet. \n  - The effect marks the `target` as searched by the `agent`, clearly indicating the state change.\n\n- **Simplicity**: \n  - The action combines the logic of searching an area and potentially gathering resources (though the specific resource-gathering logic is not explicitly needed here, it could be an implicit part of searching if extended).\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: \n  - The logical flow is consistent across contexts, as the action focuses on the universal concept of searching, which can be adapted to various tasks without complexity.\n\nThis merged action simplifies the process of searching or gathering resources, making it applicable to multiple scenarios with different agents and targets.",
    "To create a single merged action named \"start\" that combines the provided actions, we should focus on generalizing the parameters and ensuring the merged action captures the essence of both starting a fire and cooking. Here is the combined action according to the guidelines:\n\n**Merged Action:**\n```lisp\n(:action start\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?location - place ?structure - object ?resource - object ?task - task)\n  :precondition (and \n    (available ?npc)\n    (in ?npc ?location)\n    (built ?structure ?location)\n    (has ?npc ?resource)\n    (not (started ?task ?location))\n  )\n  :effect (started ?task ?location)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Generality**: We use abstract parameters like `?npc`, `?location`, `?structure`, `?resource`, and `?task` to ensure the action can adapt to various tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the transition of the entity's state from a non-started task to a started task.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single, efficient action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and maintain clear relationships between the parameters.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `?npc` - The non-player character or person.\n- `?location` - The place where the task is performed.\n- `?structure` - The object that needs to be built or present.\n- `?resource` - The necessary resource the NPC should have.\n- `?task` - The task to be started.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- The NPC is available.\n- The NPC is at the specified location.\n- The structure (like a teepee or oven) is built at the location.\n- The NPC has the necessary resource (like tinder, kindling, or cooking ingredients).\n- The task (like starting a fire or cooking) is not already started.\n\n**Effects:**\n- The task is marked as started at the location.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various contexts where a task needs to be started, such as starting a fire or beginning to cook, thereby maintaining flexibility and simplicity."

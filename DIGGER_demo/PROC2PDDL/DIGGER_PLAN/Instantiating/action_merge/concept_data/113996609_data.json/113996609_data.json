    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action, we'll focus on creating a generalized action that encapsulates the essence of both \"drink_water\" and \"carve_groove\" actions. We'll use abstract parameters to make the action adaptable to various scenarios involving the consumption or alteration of a resource. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action perform_task ; Perform a task involving resource interaction\n  :parameters (?person - agent ?resource - object ?tool - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?person ?resource)\n                  (or (and (not (salt_water ?resource)) (not (hydrated ?person))) ; For drinking tasks\n                      (has_tool ?person ?tool)) ; For carving tasks\n                )\n  :effect (and\n            (or (and (hydrated ?person) (not (thirsty ?person))) ; Effects specific to drinking\n                (and (groove_carved ?resource) (used_tool ?person ?tool))) ; Effects specific to carving\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named `perform_task` to reflect its broad applicability to tasks involving resource interaction.\n   - Parameters are kept abstract: `?person` can be any agent, `?resource` any object involved in the task, and `?tool` any object used as a tool.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - Preconditions are organized to cover different scenarios: either a person is interacting with water (for drinking) or using a tool (for carving).\n   - Effects clearly describe the state change: hydration for drinking, or carving for the tool usage.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Logical Consistency**: \n   - Unnecessary complexity is avoided by unifying similar actions under a single precondition and effect structure.\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various contexts by simply assigning different objects to the parameters, thus achieving a versatile and efficient representation of the tasks.",
    "Given the guidelines and the example provided, we will create the merged action named `carve`. This action will generalize the process of carving an object (e.g., wood) using a tool (e.g., rock). We will ensure that the merged action captures the necessary preconditions and effects from the original actions, while maintaining logical consistency and avoiding redundancy.\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```pddl\n(:action carve\n  :parameters (?person - agent ?material - object ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?person ?material)\n    (at ?tool ?material)\n    (not (carved ?material))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (carved ?material)\n    (material_textured ?material tacky)\n    (tool_used ?tool)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Action Name:** `carve` - This name broadly captures the action of carving, making it applicable to various materials and tools.\n  \n- **Parameters:** \n  - `?person - agent`: The person performing the action.\n  - `?material - object`: The material being carved.\n  - `?tool - tool`: The tool used for carving.\n\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - `(at ?person ?material)`: Ensures the person is at the location of the material.\n  - `(at ?tool ?material)`: Ensures the tool is at the location of the material.\n  - `(not (carved ?material))`: Ensures that the material has not already been carved.\n\n- **Effects:**\n  - `(carved ?material)`: Indicates that the material has been successfully carved.\n  - `(material_textured ?material tacky)`: Reflects the change in texture of the material as a result of carving.\n  - `(tool_used ?tool)`: Marks the tool as used in the process.\n\nThis merged action captures the core logic and state changes required for a carving task, ensuring simplicity and efficiency while maintaining generality and logical consistency across different contexts.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action according to the given guidelines, we need to maintain generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action check\n    ; Check a resource and update task status\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?resource - resource ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?resource)\n                    (not (checked ?agent ?item))\n                  )\n    :effect (checked ?agent ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Action Name and Parameters**:\n   - The action is named `check`, which is general and applicable to various contexts.\n   - The parameters include ?agent (to represent any agent), ?resource (to represent the location or resource being checked), and ?item (to represent the object or item being checked).\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - `(at ?agent ?resource)`: Ensures the agent is at the specified resource or location.\n   - `(not (checked ?agent ?item))`: Ensures the item has not been checked by the agent yet.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - `(checked ?agent ?item)`: Marks the item as checked by the agent.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various tasks such as checking water, hunting fish, or any other generic checking tasks, while maintaining simplicity and avoiding redundancy.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action that adheres to the guidelines provided, we will create an action named \"cook\" that is adaptable to various cooking tasks. This merged action will use abstract parameters to generalize the concept of cooking, clearly describe state changes, retain core logic, avoid redundancy, and maintain logical consistency.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action cook ; Prepare a food item using a tool\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?food - food ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and\n    (caught ?npc ?food)\n    (at ?food ?tool)\n    (not (cooked ?food))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (cooked ?food)\n  )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The action \"cook\" is defined in a way that it can be applied to any cooking task involving a person, a food item, and a tool.\n- **State Change**: The precondition checks if the food has been caught and is at the tool (e.g., fire), and not yet cooked. The effect then changes the state of the food to \"cooked\".\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action is simple, with no unnecessary complexity or redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are clear and consistent, ensuring logical transitions in different contexts.\n\nUsing this universal \"cook\" action, you can now apply it to various cooking scenarios involving different types of food and tools.",
    "To merge the actions into a single universal \"serve\" action that is general, reflects state change, maintains simplicity, and ensures logical consistency, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Generality**: Use abstract parameters to ensure the action can apply to various tasks and not just serving fish.\n2. **State Change**: Clearly define preconditions and effects to reflect the state change.\n3. **Simplicity**: Avoid redundant conditions and effects to keep the action efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Ensure preconditions and effects are reasonable and consistent across different contexts.\n\nGiven the provided example action for serving fish, we'll generalize it to create a universal \"serve\" action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action serve ; Serve an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?item - object ?container - container ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and\n    (prepared ?item)\n    (at ?container ?location)\n    (not (served ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (in ?item ?container)\n    (served ?item)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to `?item` for any object, `?container` for any type of container, and `?location` for any location.\n2. **State Change**: Preconditions ensure the item is prepared and not already served, and that the container is at the specified location. The effects indicate the item is placed in the container and marked as served.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simple and avoids redundancy by only including necessary conditions and effects.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logical and maintain consistency for various serving tasks.\n\nThis merged \"serve\" action can now be used for a variety of serving tasks beyond just serving fish, making it a versatile and efficient PDDL action."

The parameters are abstract, allowing for a variety of tasks to be adapted without specifying the type of action.\n  \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the change in state. The NPC must be at a specified location, and depending on the type of item, either a raft is created or a rescue signal is created.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining the actions into a single action with abstract parameters. The core logic of preconditions and effects is maintained without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency across different contexts. The preconditions ensure that the NPC is at the location, and the effects update the state based on the item being created.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `create` is versatile, efficient, and logically consistent, making it adaptable to various tasks involving the creation of items.",
    "To create a universal PDDL action that combines multiple actions into a single, adaptable action, we need to ensure that it is general enough to be applied across various scenarios while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity. Below is the merged action for the \"put\" operation:\n\n### Merged Action: `put`\n\n```pddl\n(:action put\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object ?from - location ?to - location)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (location ?item ?from)\n                    (can_access ?agent ?from)\n                    (not (location ?item ?to))\n                    (not (location ?agent ?to))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n             (location ?item ?to)\n             (agent_moved ?agent ?to)\n             (not (location ?item ?from))\n             (not (agent_moved ?agent ?from))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Action Name**: The action is named `put`, which reflects the operation of placing an object from one location to another.\n\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?agent`: The entity performing the action.\n  - `?item`: The object being moved.\n  - `?from`: The initial location of the object.\n  - `?to`: The destination location for the object.\n\n- **Preconditions**: \n  - The `?item` must be at the `?from` location initially.\n  - The `?agent` must be able to access the `?from` location.\n  - The item should not already be at the `?to` location.\n  - The `?agent` should not be at the `?to` location before the action.\n\n- **Effects**: \n  - The `?item` is relocated to the `?to` location.\n  - The `?agent` is moved to the `?to` location, representing the action of putting the item.\n  - The item is no longer at the `?from` location.\n  - The agent is no longer at the `?from` location.\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n1. **Generality**: The action is designed to be applicable to various `put` scenarios involving different agents, objects, and locations.\n2. **State Change**: It captures the transition of the item's and agent's location from the initial to the target state.\n3. **Simplicity**: By using abstract parameters, the action avoids unnecessary complexity and redundancy.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the action can be applied universally.\n\nThis merged action effectively combines the logic of placing an item in a new location while considering the movement and presence of the agent, reflecting a wide range of possible tasks."

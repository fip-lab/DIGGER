    "Given the provided actions, we will merge them into a single universal action named \"get\". This merged action will be capable of handling a variety of tasks related to obtaining or acquiring items. We will ensure that the preconditions and effects are abstract and adaptable to multiple contexts.\n\n### Provided Actions:\n1. `get_costume`\n   ```pddl\n   (:action get_costume\n       :parameters (?npc - npc ?c - costume)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (not (has-costume ?npc ?c)))\n       :effect (has-costume ?npc ?c)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Final Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action get ; Acquire an item and update the entity's state\n  :parameters (?entity - entity ?item - item)\n  :precondition (and (available ?entity) (not (has ?entity ?item)))\n  :effect (has ?entity ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The action is generalized to apply to any entity and item, increasing its applicability to various tasks beyond just acquiring a costume.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the entity does not already have the item, and the effect updates the state to reflect that the entity has obtained the item.\n- **Simplicity:** The action is kept simple with only necessary preconditions and effects, avoiding redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The logic remains consistent across different contexts, ensuring clarity in preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action \"get\" can now be used in a variety of situations where an entity needs to acquire an item, making it a versatile and efficient action in the PDDL framework.",
    "Based on the guidelines and principles provided, the merged action for \"clean\" that encapsulates the given tasks while adhering to the objectives of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency could be as follows:\n\n### Merged Action: clean\n\n#### Action sets that need to be merged:\n1. **Clean Clothing**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action clean_clothing\n       :parameters (?c - clothing)\n       :precondition (and (clothing-dirty ?c))\n       :effect (and (not (clothing-dirty ?c)) (clothing-clean ?c))\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Decorate Helmet**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action decorate_helmet\n       :parameters (?h - helmet)\n       :precondition (and (helmet-plain ?h))\n       :effect (and (not (helmet-plain ?h)) (helmet-decorated ?h))\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean\n    :parameters (?item - object)\n    :precondition (and\n        (or (clothing-dirty ?item)\n            (helmet-plain ?item)))\n    :effect (and\n        (when (clothing-dirty ?item)\n            (and (not (clothing-dirty ?item))\n                 (clothing-clean ?item)))\n        (when (helmet-plain ?item)\n            (and (not (helmet-plain ?item))\n                 (helmet-decorated ?item))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality:** The merged action `clean` uses the abstract parameter `?item - object`, allowing it to adapt to various cleaning and decorating tasks, whether it's cleaning clothing or decorating helmets.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes for both types of items. It removes the dirty state from clothing and adds the clean state, and similarly, it changes the helmet from plain to decorated.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by combining cleaning and decorating tasks into a single action without unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic for different tasks by using conditional effects (`when` clauses) to handle different types of items appropriately.\n\nThis merged action ensures that the core logic of preconditions and effects is retained, applicable to multiple contexts, and is simple and efficient.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action named `decorate`, we need to ensure that the action is generic enough to cover various tasks related to \"decorating\" or transforming an entity's state. Here is how this can be achieved:\n\n```pddl\n(:action decorate ; Decorate an item and update its status\n:parameters (?npc - entity ?item - object)\n:precondition (and\n                (decoratable ?item)\n                (possesses ?npc ?item)\n                (not (decorated ?item)))\n:effect (and\n          (not (plain ?item))\n          (decorated ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Parameters**: We use abstract parameters `?npc` and `?item` to represent a generic entity and object, allowing this action to be applicable to a variety of tasks beyond just helmets and NPCs. This increases the action's adaptability.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: The action checks if the `?item` is `decoratable`, ensuring that it can be decorated. It also checks if the `?npc` possesses the `?item` and that it is not already `decorated`. This ensures that the action is only applied when meaningful.\n   - **Effects**: The action's effect changes the state from `plain` to `decorated`, capturing the transformation of the item's state. This represents the decoration process.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are minimal and necessary to capture the essence of a decoration action. This avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains a consistent logic that can be applied to different contexts, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action captures the core logic of decorating an item while being adaptable to various scenarios beyond the specific cases initially provided.",
    "\nTo combine the given actions into a single universal action \"make\" that captures all the essential preconditions and effects, we need to abstract the parameters and ensure that the action maintains logical consistency, simplicity, and generality. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action make\n  :parameters (?npc - entity ?item - object ?state1 - state ?state2 - state)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (has ?npc ?item) \n                  (?state1 ?item)\n                  (not (?state2 ?item)))\n  :effect (and \n            (not (?state1 ?item))\n            (?state2 ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters `?npc` and `?item` are abstracted to apply to any entity and object, respectively.\n   - The parameters `?state1` and `?state2` represent the states that the item will transition between, allowing for flexibility across different types of state changes (e.g., visibility, cleanliness, decoration).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the `?npc` has the `?item` and that the `?item` is in `?state1` but not in `?state2`.\n   - The effects describe the transition of the `?item` from `?state1` to `?state2`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions and effects are removed, resulting in a cleaner and more efficient action representation.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring that the action is reasonable and applicable to various tasks.\n\n### Examples of usage:\n1. **Make Helmet Invisible**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action make\n     :parameters (?npc - npc ?h - helmet ?helmet-visible - state ?helmet-invisible - state)\n     :precondition (and\n                     (has ?npc ?h)\n                     (helmet-visible ?h)\n                     (not (helmet-invisible ?h)))\n     :effect (and\n               (not (helmet-visible ?h))\n               (helmet-invisible ?h))\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Clean Clothing**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action make\n     :parameters (?npc - npc ?c - clothing ?dirty - state ?clean - state)\n     :precondition (and\n                     (has ?npc ?c)\n                     (dirty ?c)\n                     (not (clean ?c)))\n     :effect (and\n               (not (dirty ?c))\n               (clean ?c))\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Decorate Helmet**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action make\n     :parameters (?npc - npc ?h - helmet ?plain - state ?camouflaged - state)\n     :precondition (and\n                     (has ?npc ?h)\n                     (plain ?h)\n                     (not (camouflaged ?h)))\n     :effect (and\n               (not (plain ?h))\n               (camouflaged ?h))\n   )\n   ```\n\nWith this universal action \"make\", you can adapt to a wide variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states for different entities and objects, ensuring simplicity, efficiency, and logical consistency."

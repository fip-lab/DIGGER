    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal PDDL action named `replace`, let's follow the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. We'll create an abstract action that can apply to a variety of tasks, particularly those involving replacing or modifying states of objects.\n\n### Merged Action: Replace\n\n```lisp\n(:action replace\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?location - place ?item - thing)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (not (desired_state ?item)))\n    :effect (and (desired_state ?item) (not (undesired_state ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is designed to be general and applicable to multiple scenarios where an agent (`?actor`) performs an operation at a location (`?location`) to change the state of an item (`?item`).\n   - The use of abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?location`, `?item`) makes it adaptable to different contexts beyond just papyrus or sheets.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition checks if the `?actor` is at the `?location` and if the `?item` is not in the `desired_state`.\n   - The effect transforms the `?item` into the `desired_state` and ensures it is no longer in the `undesired_state`.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into one and removing unnecessary complexity.\n   - It captures the core logic of the original actions: changing the state of an item through a specific process.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different tasks, ensuring the action can be used in various contexts without modification.\n\n### Application:\n\nThis universal `replace` action can be used for tasks such as drying papyrus, polishing sheets, or any other task where an item needs to transition from one state to another with the involvement of an agent at a specific location. The abstract parameters allow for flexibility and adaptability in different scenarios.",
    "Here is the merged action following your guidelines:\n\n```pddl\n(:action lay ; Lay an item and update its state\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (ready ?item)\n                    (at ?item ?location)\n                    (position ?item ?initial_state)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (position ?item ?final_state)\n              (not (position ?item ?initial_state))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **Generality:** The action `lay` is designed to be adaptable to multiple tasks by using abstract parameters `?npc`, `?item`, and `?location`. This ensures that the action is not limited to specific types of items, agents, or locations.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions check the initial state of the item (`ready`, `at`, `position ?initial_state`), and the effects describe the transformation to the final state (`position ?final_state`, `not (position ?initial_state)`).\n3. **Simplicity:** The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the similar aspects of potential actions (e.g., changing the state of an item from `vertical` to `horizontal`).\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The logic remains clear and consistent. Preconditions and effects are reasonable across different contexts, ensuring clarity and applicability to various tasks.",
    "Sure, I can help with that. Let's merge the provided actions into a single universal action called \"dip\" that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere are the actions that need to be merged:\n\n1. **dip_strips**:\n```\n(:action dip_strips\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?s - strip)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (dry ?s)\n                    (laid_out ?s)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (wet ?s)\n              (soaked ?s)\n              (not (dry ?s))\n            )\n)\n```\n\nConsidering the guidelines, here's the merged action:\n\n```\n(:action dip ; Universally adaptable action to dip an item and change its state\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (dry ?item) (laid_out ?item))\n  :effect (and (wet ?item) (soaked ?item) (not (dry ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?agent` and `?item`) to make the action adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: Preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change of the `item` from dry to wet and soaked.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects and keeping the action concise.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency with reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action `dip` is now a universal action that can be adapted to different contexts involving an agent dipping an item and changing its state.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"cut,\" we'll follow the guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Let's analyze the provided actions and create a merged action.\n\n### Given Actions:\n\n1. **Cut Stalks**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action cut_stalks\n       :parameters (?npc - agent ?p - papyrus)\n       :precondition (and (has ?npc ?p) (not (stalks_cut ?p)))\n       :effect (stalks_cut ?p)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Peel Papyrus Strips** (Though not provided, I will assume the structure based on the given example)\n   ```lisp\n   (:action peel_papyrus_strips\n       :parameters (?npc - agent ?p - papyrus)\n       :precondition (and (stalks_cut ?p) (not (strips_peeled ?p)))\n       :effect (strips_peeled ?p)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\nTo create a universal \"cut\" action, we need to ensure that the action can apply to both cutting stalks and peeling strips, abstracting the task to a general form:\n\n```lisp\n(:action cut\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object ?state_before - predicate ?state_after - predicate)\n    :precondition (and (has ?npc ?item) (not (?state_after ?item)) (?state_before ?item))\n    :effect (?state_after ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstracted to `?item` and predicates `?state_before` and `?state_after` are used, allowing the action to be adaptable to various tasks (e.g., cutting stalks, peeling strips).\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect a clear state change from `?state_before` to `?state_after`.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by generalizing the predicates and parameters.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions ensure that the agent has the item and the transformation hasn't occurred yet, maintaining logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can now be used to represent both cutting stalks and peeling papyrus strips by substituting specific predicates for `?state_before` and `?state_after` as needed.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"peel\" that aligns with the provided guidelines, we need to ensure that it can handle different tasks (checking, modifying, creating), describe state changes clearly, and maintain simplicity and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action peel ; Peel a resource and update task status\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and \n    (available ?npc) \n    (or \n      (and (papyrus ?item) (stalks_cut ?item) (not (peeled ?item)))\n      (and (papyrus ?item) (not (polished ?item)) (has-tool ?npc ?shell))\n    )\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (or \n      (peeled ?item)\n      (polished ?item)\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?npc` and `?item` to handle a variety of tasks involving different objects. The action is generalized to work with any agent and object.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly outline the change in the state of the `?item`. Depending on the specific context (whether it is peeling or polishing), the state is updated appropriately.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single action. It checks for either peeling or polishing based on the state of the `?item`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions ensure that the action only proceeds if the necessary conditions are met (e.g., the papyrus stalks need to be cut before peeling, and the agent must have a tool before polishing). The effects consistently update the state of the `?item` based on the task being performed.\n\nIn this way, the merged action \"peel\" can handle various tasks related to checking, modifying, or creating the state of an object while maintaining clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency.",

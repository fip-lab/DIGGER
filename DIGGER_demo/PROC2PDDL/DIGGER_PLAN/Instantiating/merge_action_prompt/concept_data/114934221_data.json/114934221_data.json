The precondition checks if the spear gun is in the vehicle and not on the ground. The effect changes the spear gun's location to on the ground.\n- **attack_ship**: This action involves the NPC attacking a ship in the deep sea. The precondition checks if the ship is in open water and the NPC is in the deep sea. The effect moves the ship to the dock and sets it in motion.\n- **defend**: This action involves the NPC defending against an attack in the deep sea. The precondition checks if the NPC is in the deep sea and the ship is in open water. The effect moves the ship to the dock and steadies it.\n- **block_path**: This action involves the NPC blocking the path of a shark with a spear. The precondition checks if the spear is on the ground, the shark is in the ocean, and not near the NPC. The effect moves the shark near the NPC and deters it.\n- **take_shot**: This action involves the NPC taking a shot at the shark. The precondition checks if the shark is near the NPC and the NPC has a spear gun. The effect deters the shark and injures it.\n\nThese actions are designed to capture the logical steps and conditions required to achieve the task \"ultimate_win.\"\nThe actions after the merger are:"

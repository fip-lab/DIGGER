The preconditions ensure that the building is strong, has a basement, and is a safe location. The effects indicate that the NPC is now in the shelter, protected, and hidden.\n\n2. **clean_house**: This action describes cleaning the house (building) to ensure it is not messy or dusty. The preconditions check if the building is messy and dusty, and the effects change the state to clean.\n\n3. **cover_basement**: This action involves covering the basement with a drop cloth to make it safe. Preconditions check if the drop cloth is in the basement and the basement is not covered. The effects indicate that the basement is now covered and safe.\n\n4. **camouflage_helmet**: This action describes camouflaging the NPC's helmet. The preconditions ensure the NPC is wearing the helmet and the helmet is plain. The effects indicate that the helmet is now camouflaged and the NPC is hidden.\n\nThese actions align with the task of finding shelter and the descriptions provided.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The preconditions ensure that the NPC is at the beach and that the raft draft is available. The effects indicate that the raft is created and is present at the beach, and the raft draft is no longer available.\n\n2. **create_rescue_signal**: This action involves an NPC creating a rescue signal on the beach. The precondition ensures that the NPC is at the beach. The effect indicates that a rescue signal has been created at the beach.\n\nThese actions capture the intent and logic of the steps and descriptions provided, ensuring that the NPC can create a raft and a rescue signal at the beach."

If there are additional steps or tasks related to creating a shelter, more PDDL actions would be needed to cover those aspects."

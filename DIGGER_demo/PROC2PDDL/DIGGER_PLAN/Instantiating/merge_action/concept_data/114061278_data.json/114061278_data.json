The precondition ensures the screwdriver is in hand and not yet positioned. The effect is that the screwdriver is now positioned on the coconut.\n- **poke-eye**: This action uses a mallet to poke the eye of the coconut. The precondition checks that the screwdriver is positioned and the mallet is in hand. The effect is that the coconut's eye is poked, and the screwdriver is removed.\n- **remove-screwdriver**: This action removes the screwdriver after poking the coconut's eye. The precondition requires that the eye has been poked, and the effect is that the screwdriver is removed.\n\nThese actions capture the logical steps and states involved in the task of poking a hole in a coconut using a screwdriver and a mallet."

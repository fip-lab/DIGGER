If all of the electronics suddenly stop working, the immediate loss of electricity will cause a lot of sudden confusion and chaos. If you aren\u2019t home, wait 30-45 minutes for all of the abrupt danger to pass. Then, go home if you\u2019re within a few miles or kilometers. If you\u2019re already home, stay there and do not go outside.\n- Eat anything in your fridge first to minimize food shortages. For the first 1-2 days, eat whatever is in your fridge and hasn\u2019t gone bad immediately. Save the dry stuff for later when you may really need it. The odds are low society will completely collapse and you\u2019ll go without help for super long, but it\u2019s still better to go through everything that\u2019s going to go bad anyway.\n\n### Entity State:\n- bathtub: \n  - Before: empty\n  - After: full\n- npc:\n  - Before: located at bathtub\n  - After: has water\n\nThese actions reflect the steps provided for the task \"collect-water\". The preconditions and effects are based on the entity states before and after each action."

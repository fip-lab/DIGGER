Push the end of the hanger in through the soft rubber weather stripping and the bottom of the window. The hanger is now inside the wall of the door.\n\n2. **Hook Latch with Hanger**: Hook and pull the latch. Hook the hanger around the latch and pull it towards the rear of the car. This should unlock any manually locked car door.\n\n3. **Straighten Coat Hanger**: Unravel and straighten the coat hanger. You can leave the hooked top section alone, but unwind it from itself at the \u201cneck\u201d and straighten the rest of the hanger out, giving you a long metal tool with a hooked tip.\n\n### Entity State:\n- **Car**:\n  - **Vehicle**:\n    - **Attribute: Location**: Before: in garage, After: in forest\n    - **Attribute: Visibility**: Before: visible, After: invisible\n    - **Attribute: Vehicle**: Before: uncovered, After: netted with camouflage\n  - **Concept Knowledge**:\n    - [[drive]] is related to [[car]]\n    - You are likely to find [[a car]] in [[the city]]\n    - [[A car]] can [[go fast]]\n    - [[a car]] has [[seats]]\n    - [[A tire]] is part of [[a car]]\n    - [[A volvo]] is a type of [[car]]\n    - [[my car]] is [[red]]\n\n- **NPC**:\n  - **Helmet**:\n    - **Attribute: Decoration**: Before: bare | plain, After: camouflaged\n    - **Attribute: Visibility**: Before: visible, After: invisible\n  - **Concept Knowledge**: []\n\nThese PDDL actions capture the intent and logic of each step described in the task."

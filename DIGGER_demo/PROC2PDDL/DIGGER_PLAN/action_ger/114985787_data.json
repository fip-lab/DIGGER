    "Certainly! Let's generate the PDDL actions for the task \"build_shelter\" based on the provided steps and descriptions.\n\n### PDDL Actions\n\n1. **Action: make_splash**\n\n```lisp\n(:action make_splash\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?p - path ?o - oak_log ?b - branch)\n    :precondition (and (at ?n ?p) (not (supported ?b ?o)))\n    :effect (supported ?b ?o)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This action involves using a branch and an oak log to create a support structure. The precondition checks if the `npc` is at the `path` and the branch is not yet supported by the log. The effect is that the branch is now supported by the log.\n\n2. **Action: drink_water**\n\n```lisp\n(:action drink_water\n    :parameters (?n - npc)\n    :precondition (and (has_no_container ?n) (clear_water_available))\n    :effect (hydrated ?n)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This action allows the `npc` to drink water when no container is available. The precondition ensures that the `npc` has no container and clear water is available. The effect is that the `npc` becomes hydrated.\n\n3. **Action: build_shelter**\n\n```lisp\n(:action build_shelter\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?c - camp ?t - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and (at ?n ?c) (supported_structure ?t))\n    :effect (shelter_built ?t)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This action constructs the shelter. The precondition checks if the `npc` is at the `camp` and there is a supported structure. The effect is that the shelter is built.\n\n4. **Action: place_branch**\n\n```lisp\n(:action place_branch\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?w - west_plain ?b - branch_piece)\n    :precondition (and (at ?n ?w) (not (placed ?b)))\n    :effect (placed ?b)\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:** This action involves placing a branch piece at a specified location. The precondition checks if the `npc` is at the `west_plain` and the branch piece is not yet placed. The effect is that the branch piece is placed.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe actions above are crafted to align with the task of building a shelter using the given steps and descriptions. Each action is defined with appropriate parameters, preconditions, and effects, capturing the essence of the task in PDDL format.",
    "To generate PDDL actions for the task \"eat_plants\" based on the provided steps and descriptions, we need to create actions that reflect the logical sequence and conditions described. Here are the PDDL actions:\n\n```pddl\n;; Action to get water\n(:action get_water\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?w - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n      (source_of_water_available)\n      (thirsty ?npc)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (has_water ?npc ?w)\n      (not (thirsty ?npc))\n    )\n)\n\n;; Action to eat fruit\n(:action eat_fruit\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?b - berry)\n    :precondition (and\n      (identifiable_berry_bush ?b)\n      (edible ?b)\n      (hungry ?npc)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (not (hungry ?npc))\n      (has_eaten ?npc ?b)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Action: get_water**\n   - **Parameters**: `?npc` represents the agent (non-player character) and `?w` represents the water resource.\n   - **Preconditions**: The action requires that there is a source of water available and that the NPC is thirsty.\n   - **Effects**: After the action, the NPC has water and is no longer thirsty.\n\n2. **Action: eat_fruit**\n   - **Parameters**: `?npc` represents the agent and `?b` represents the berry.\n   - **Preconditions**: The action requires that there is an identifiable berry bush with edible berries and that the NPC is hungry.\n   - **Effects**: After the action, the NPC is no longer hungry and has eaten the berries.\n\nThese actions capture the essence of the task \"eat_plants\" by focusing on obtaining water and safely consuming identifiable edible berries.",
    "Certainly! Let's generate the PDDL actions for the task \"build_snare\" based on the provided steps and descriptions.\n\nTask: build_snare\n\nSteps:\nStep 1: get_snare npc snare\n\nDescriptions:\n- Look for edible mushrooms in the woods, if you are trained. Look for wild mushrooms near dark and damp areas or on dying trees in the woods. But be very careful because if you eat the wrong mushroom, you could become extremely ill and potentially die. If you're not sure about whether or not a mushroom is safe to eat, don't eat it!\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Get Snare\n(:action get_snare\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?snare - snare)\n    :precondition (not (has_snare ?npc ?snare))\n    :effect (has_snare ?npc ?snare)\n)\n```\n\nSince the descriptions provided are about looking for mushrooms and are not directly relevant to the task of building a snare, they will not be included in the PDDL actions. Instead, we will focus on the task-specific steps.\n\nGiven the task \"build_snare\" and only one step provided, here is the corresponding PDDL action for the step:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Get Snare\n(:action get_snare\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?snare - snare)\n    :precondition (not (has_snare ?npc ?snare))\n    :effect (has_snare ?npc ?snare)\n)\n```\n\nIf there are more steps or specific details about the snare-building process, please provide them so that I can generate additional actions accordingly."

    "Here are the PDDL actions for the task \"get_coconut_juice\" based on the provided steps and descriptions:\n\nTask: get_coconut_juice\n\nSteps:\n- peel coconut\n- drain coconut rack\n\nDescriptions:\n- Use a knife to shave off the tender white casing. Position your young coconut on a cutting board, and use a sharp cleaver or a sturdy chef\u2019s knife to slice off the outer casing. Carve at an angle, as if you were removing the skin from an apple, until you expose the hard inner shell. Work to expose as much of the shell as possible.\n- Turn the coconut upside down over a glass and allow it to drain. Let the coconut sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get the last bit of water out of it.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action peel_coconut\n  :parameters (?c - coconut ?n - knife ?b - cutting_board)\n  :precondition (and\n    (on ?c ?b)\n    (sharp ?n)\n    (not (exposed_shell ?c))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (exposed_shell ?c)\n    (not (covered ?c))\n  )\n)\n\n(:action drain_coconut\n  :parameters (?c - coconut ?g - glass ?r - rack)\n  :precondition (and\n    (exposed_shell ?c)\n    (empty ?g)\n    (on ?c ?r)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (in ?juice ?g)\n    (not (in ?juice ?c))\n    (not (empty ?g))\n  )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation of PDDL Actions:\n\n1. **Action Name**: `peel_coconut`\n   - **Parameters**: \n     - `?c - coconut`: The coconut to be peeled.\n     - `?n - knife`: The knife used for peeling.\n     - `?b - cutting_board`: The cutting board where the coconut is placed.\n   - **Preconditions**: \n     - `(on ?c ?b)`: The coconut is on the cutting board.\n     - `(sharp ?n)`: The knife is sharp.\n     - `(not (exposed_shell ?c))`: The coconut shell is not yet exposed.\n   - **Effects**: \n     - `(exposed_shell ?c)`: The coconut shell is now exposed.\n     - `(not (covered ?c))`: The coconut is no longer covered by its outer casing.\n\n2. **Action Name**: `drain_coconut`\n   - **Parameters**: \n     - `?c - coconut`: The coconut to be drained.\n     - `?g - glass`: The glass to collect the juice.\n     - `?r - rack`: The rack where the coconut is placed upside down.\n   - **Preconditions**: \n     - `(exposed_shell ?c)`: The coconut shell is exposed.\n     - `(empty ?g)`: The glass is empty.\n     - `(on ?c ?r)`: The coconut is placed on the rack.\n   - **Effects**: \n     - `(in ?juice ?g)`: The juice is now in the glass.\n     - `(not (in ?juice ?c))`: The juice is no longer in the coconut.\n     - `(not (empty ?g))`: The glass is no longer empty.\n\nThese actions should accurately capture the steps and descriptions provided for the task of getting coconut juice.",
    "Sure, let's generate the PDDL actions for the given task and steps.\n\nTask: get_coconut_meat_without_oven\n\nSteps:\n- wrap coconut_wrapped towel1\n- peel coconut\n- drain coconut rack\n- break coconut\n\nDescriptions:\n- Wrap the mature coconut in a kitchen towel. Place the coconut in the center of the towel, and gather the corners of the towel together to form a pouch. This will keep coconut bits from flying when you go to smash it with a hammer.\n- Use a knife to shave off the tender white casing. Position your young coconut on a cutting board, and use a sharp cleaver or a sturdy chef\u2019s knife to slice off the outer casing. Carve at an angle, as if you were removing the skin from an apple, until you expose the hard inner shell. Work to expose as much of the shell as possible.\n- Turn the coconut upside down over a glass and allow it to drain. Let the coconut sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get the last bit of water out of it.\n- Whack the wrapped coconut with a hammer, or bash it against a hard surface. With the coconut still wrapped in the towel, use a hammer or a mallet to repeatedly and forcefully whack the coconut. Turn the coconut as you hammer it, in order to strike it from multiple angles. Hammer it until you feel it break open beneath the towel.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n(:action wrap-coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?t - towel)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (not (wrapped ?c))\n                    (towel_available ?t)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (wrapped ?c)\n              (not (towel_available ?t))\n            )\n)\n\n(:action peel-coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?k - knife)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (wrapped ?c)\n                    (knife_available ?k)\n                    (not (peeled ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (peeled ?c)\n              (not (knife_available ?k))\n            )\n)\n\n(:action drain-coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?r - rack)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (peeled ?c)\n                    (rack_available ?r)\n                    (not (drained ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (drained ?c)\n              (not (rack_available ?r))\n            )\n)\n\n(:action break-coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?h - hammer)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (wrapped ?c)\n                    (drained ?c)\n                    (hammer_available ?h)\n                    (not (broken ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (broken ?c)\n              (not (hammer_available ?h))\n            )\n)\n\nThese actions should capture the steps required to get coconut meat without using an oven, as described.",
    "Based on the task \"get_coconut_meat_with_oven\" and the provided steps and descriptions, here are the PDDL actions that align with the task:\n\n```pddl\n(:action peel_coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?n - knife)\n    :precondition (and (has_outer_casing ?c) (sharp ?n) (on_cutting_board ?c))\n    :effect (and (exposed_inner_shell ?c) (not (has_outer_casing ?c)))\n)\n\n(:action drain_coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?g - glass)\n    :precondition (and (exposed_inner_shell ?c) (full_of_liquid ?c))\n    :effect (and (empty ?c) (full ?g))\n)\n\n(:action wrap_coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?t - towel)\n    :precondition (and (exposed_inner_shell ?c) (empty ?c))\n    :effect (and (wrapped ?c ?t))\n)\n\n(:action break_coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?t - towel ?h - hammer)\n    :precondition (and (wrapped ?c ?t) (empty ?c) (has_inner_shell ?c))\n    :effect (and (broken ?c) (not (has_inner_shell ?c)))\n)\n\n(:action remove_coconut_meat\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?n - knife)\n    :precondition (and (broken ?c) (has_meat ?c))\n    :effect (and (meat_separated ?c) (not (has_meat ?c)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **peel_coconut**: This action involves using a knife to remove the outer casing of the coconut to expose the inner shell.\n- **drain_coconut**: This action involves turning the coconut upside down to drain its liquid into a glass.\n- **wrap_coconut**: This action involves wrapping the coconut in a towel to prevent bits from flying when it is broken.\n- **break_coconut**: This action involves breaking the coconut with a hammer while it is wrapped in a towel.\n- **remove_coconut_meat**: This action involves using a knife to separate the coconut meat from the shell after it has been broken.\n\nThese actions capture the logical steps required to obtain coconut meat using the descriptions and ensure all necessary conditions and effects are covered."

Push the end of the hanger in through the soft rubber weather stripping and the bottom of the window. The hanger is now inside the wall of the door.\n- Hook and pull the latch. Hook the hanger around the latch and pull it towards the rear of the car. This should unlock any manually locked car door.\n- Unravel and straighten the coat hanger. You can leave the hooked top section alone, but unwind it from itself at the \u201cneck\u201d and straighten the rest of the hanger out, giving you a long metal tool with a hooked tip.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```pddl\n;;; Action 1: Straighten Coat Hanger\n(:action straighten_coathanger\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?h - hanger)\n    :precondition (and\n      (not (straight ?h))\n      (has ?npc ?h)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (straight ?h)\n      (not (not_straight ?h))\n    )\n)\n\n;;; Action 2: Push Hanger into Car Door\n(:action push_hanger\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - car ?h - hanger)\n    :precondition (and\n      (straight ?h)\n      (has ?npc ?h)\n      (closed ?c)\n      (not (inside ?h ?c))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (inside ?h ?c)\n      (not (outside ?h ?c))\n    )\n)\n\n;;; Action 3: Hook and Pull Latch\n(:action hook_latch\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - car ?h - hanger)\n    :precondition (and\n      (inside ?h ?c)\n      (has ?npc ?h)\n      (locked ?c)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (unlocked ?c)\n      (not (locked ?c))\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThese actions should effectively capture the steps and descriptions provided for the task of picking a car lock.",

    "Sure, I'll generate the PDDL actions for the given task \"hunt_animal_for_food\" based on the steps and descriptions provided.\n\nTask: hunt_animal_for_food\n\nSteps:\n- hunt_path npc path\n- carve_groove person wood rock\n- test_food npc\n\nDescriptions:\n- Heating the water above 185\u00b0 F (85\u00b0 C) for three minutes will kill all pathogens in your water.\n- Hunt for fish, insects, and small animals for food. The protein and nutrients from meat and fish will give you energy. Mollusks, clams, oysters, crabs, muscles, and fish are all things that you may be able to find in the shallow waters surrounding or on an island.\n- Test the food you eat for poison. If you've never eaten the fruit that you find on the island, test it for poison by rubbing it on a sensitive part of your skin, like your wrist. Wait 45 minutes. If there is no adverse reaction, rub some of the food on your lips. If you form a rash, or there is burning or irritation, then the food is most likely poisonous. Never eat large amounts of any unknown food. Eat a small amount, wait an hour or two to see if you feel sick, then eat the rest of it.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```lisp\n(:action hunt_animal\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?path - location)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?npc ?path)\n      (not (hunted ?npc))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (hunted ?npc)\n    )\n  )\n\n(:action carve_groove\n    :parameters (?person - agent ?wood - material ?rock - tool)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?person ?wood)\n      (at ?person ?rock)\n      (not (carved ?wood))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (carved ?wood)\n    )\n  )\n\n(:action test_food\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?food - ingredient)\n    :precondition (and\n      (found ?food)\n      (not (tested ?food))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (tested ?food)\n      (safe ?food)\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **hunt_animal**: This action represents the NPC hunting for food along a path.\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC (`?npc`) and the path (`?path`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The NPC is at the path and has not yet hunted.\n   - **Effects**: The NPC has hunted.\n\n2. **carve_groove**: This action represents a person carving a groove into wood using a rock.\n   - **Parameters**: The person (`?person`), the wood (`?wood`), and the rock (`?rock`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person is at the wood and rock, and the wood is not yet carved.\n   - **Effects**: The wood is carved.\n\n3. **test_food**: This action represents testing food for poison.\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC (`?npc`) and the food (`?food`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The food has been found and not yet tested.\n   - **Effects**: The food is tested and marked as safe.\n\nThese actions capture the steps and logic of the task \"hunt_animal_for_food\" based on the given descriptions and steps."

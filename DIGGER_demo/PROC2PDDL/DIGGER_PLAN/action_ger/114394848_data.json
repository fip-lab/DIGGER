    "Based on the task \"hacking2_1\" and the provided steps and descriptions, here are the PDDL actions:\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n1. **Action: secure_machine**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action secure_machine\n       :parameters (?m - machine)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (not (machine-secured ?m))\n                       (authorization-granted ?m))\n       :effect (machine-secured ?m)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Action: break_password**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action break_password\n       :parameters (?npc - non_player_character ?malware - tool)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (machine-secured target_machine)\n                       (not (password-broken ?npc)))\n       :effect (password-broken ?npc)\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Action: create_backdoor**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action create_backdoor\n       :parameters (?npc - non_player_character ?malware - tool)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (password-broken ?npc)\n                       (not (backdoor-created ?npc)))\n       :effect (backdoor-created ?npc)\n   )\n   ```\n\n4. **Action: get_superuser_privileges**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action get_superuser_privileges\n       :parameters (?npc - non_player_character)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (backdoor-created ?npc)\n                       (not (superuser-privileges-granted ?npc)))\n       :effect (superuser-privileges-granted ?npc)\n   )\n   ```\n\n5. **Action: know_target**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action know_target\n       :parameters (?npc - non_player_character)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (superuser-privileges-granted ?npc)\n                       (not (target-identified ?npc)))\n       :effect (target-identified ?npc)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **secure_machine**: This action ensures that the machine is secured and that authorization is granted before any hacking activities begin.\n- **break_password**: This action involves breaking the password of a non-player character (NPC) using malware, assuming the machine is already secured.\n- **create_backdoor**: After breaking the password, a backdoor is created for persistent access.\n- **get_superuser_privileges**: Once the backdoor is established, the action to gain superuser privileges is executed.\n- **know_target**: Finally, with superuser privileges, the hacker can identify the target.\n\nThese actions follow the logical sequence of steps in hacking activities, ensuring that each action is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one.",
    "Sure, here are the PDDL actions based on the given task and steps:\n\nTask: hacking1_1\n\nSteps:\n- learn npc s_search\n- learn npc s_unix\n- learn npc malware creating_back_door\n- learn npc s_py\n- learn npc s_ethics\n\nDescriptions:\n- Learn how to use the internet and HTML. If you are going to hack, you'll need to know how to use the internet. Not just how to use a web browser, but also how to use advanced search engine techniques. You will also need to know how to create internet content using HTML. Learning HTML will also teach you some good mental habits that will help you with learning to program.\n- Get an open-sourced Unix-based system and learn to use it. There is a wide family of operating systems that are based on Unix, including Linux. The vast majority of web servers on the internet are Unix-based. So you'll need to learn Unix if you want to hack the internet.\n- Understand what hacking is. Broadly speaking, hacking refers to a variety of techniques that are used to compromise or gain access to a digital system. This can be a computer, mobile phone or tablet, or an entire network. Hacking involves a variety of specialized skills. Some are very technical. Others are more psychological. There are lots of different types of hackers that are motivated by a variety of different reasons.\n- Learn how to program. Learning a programming language might take time, so you need to be patient. Focus on learning to think like a programmer instead of learning individual languages. Focus on similar concepts in all programming languages.\n- Understand the ethics of hacking. Despite the ways hackers are depicted in popular culture, hacking is neither good nor bad. It can be used for either. Hackers are simply people who are skilled in technology who like to solve problems and overcome limitations. You can use your skills as a hacker to find solutions to problems, or you can use your skills to create problems and engage in illegal activity.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action to learn how to use the internet and HTML\n(:action learn_s_search\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (not (knows ?npc s_search))\n    :effect (knows ?npc s_search)\n)\n\n;; Action to learn how to use Unix-based systems\n(:action learn_s_unix\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (not (knows ?npc s_unix))\n    :effect (knows ?npc s_unix)\n)\n\n;; Action to learn about creating backdoors with malware\n(:action learn_creating_back_door\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (not (knows ?npc creating_back_door))\n    :effect (knows ?npc creating_back_door)\n)\n\n;; Action to learn programming\n(:action learn_s_py\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (not (knows ?npc s_py))\n    :effect (knows ?npc s_py)\n)\n\n;; Action to learn the ethics of hacking\n(:action learn_s_ethics\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (not (knows ?npc s_ethics))\n    :effect (knows ?npc s_ethics)\n)\n```\n\nThese actions capture the learning steps necessary for the task of becoming proficient in hacking-related skills. Each action ensures that the NPC learns a specific skill, with preconditions ensuring the NPC does not already possess that knowledge."

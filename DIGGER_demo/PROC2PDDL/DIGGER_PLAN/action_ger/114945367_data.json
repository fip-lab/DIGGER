    "Sure, let's generate the PDDL actions for the task \"build_a_shelter\" based on the provided steps and descriptions.\n\nTask: build_a_shelter\n\nSteps:\n- build_shelter npc camp stick2\n\nDescriptions:\n- Lean branches against the main branch to form the structure of your shelter. Gather a bunch of branches that are long enough to be propped up against the main branch of your shelter. Think about forming ribs with the branches. Try to keep them as close together as you can.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action: gather_branches\n(:action gather_branches\n    :parameters (?b - branch)\n    :precondition (not (gathered ?b))\n    :effect (gathered ?b)\n)\n\n;; Action: lean_branch\n(:action lean_branch\n    :parameters (?b - branch ?m - main_branch)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (gathered ?b)\n                    (not (leaned ?b))\n                  )\n    :effect (leaned ?b)\n)\n\n;; Action: build_shelter\n(:action build_shelter\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?c - camp ?m - main_branch)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (leaned ?m)\n                    (not (shelter_built ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (shelter_built ?c)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation of PDDL Actions:\n\n1. **gather_branches**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?b - branch`\n   - **Preconditions**: The branch should not already be gathered.\n   - **Effects**: The branch is marked as gathered.\n\n2. **lean_branch**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?b - branch ?m - main_branch`\n   - **Preconditions**: The branch should be gathered and not already leaned.\n   - **Effects**: The branch is marked as leaned against the main branch.\n\n3. **build_shelter**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?n - npc ?c - camp ?m - main_branch`\n   - **Preconditions**: The main branch should be leaned and the shelter should not already be built.\n   - **Effects**: The shelter is marked as built.\n\nThese actions capture the process of gathering branches, leaning them against a main branch, and ultimately building the shelter.",

    "Sure, let's create the PDDL actions based on the task and steps provided.\n\nTask: start_a_fire\n\nSteps:\n- start_fire npc camp teepee_structure\n- cook npc camp teepee_structure campfire\n- build_shelter npc camp teepee_structure\n- search_area area2\n- build_teepee npc camp teepee_structure\n\nDescriptions:\n- Find small, dry material to use as tinder. Look for dry grass, leaves, tree bark, pine needles, or any other small flammable materials you can find in the area. Tinder needs to be material that is easy to light and will produce a large flame so you can start your fire.\n- Use dry sticks, branches, or tree bark to serve as your kindling.\n- Avoid using too much energy. It may be difficult for you to find adequate food and water if you're lost in the woods. Try not to sweat or use too much energy by doing things like running around and screaming for help if you're by yourself. Conserve as much energy as you can for doing things like building shelter, fire, and searching for water.\n- Search for a dry, flat area between 2 trees with splits in their trunks. Look around the area to find a relatively flat area with a tree that has a trunk that splits about 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52 m) off of the ground. If possible, try to find 2 trees that have a split in their trunks about 3\u20135 feet (0.91\u20131.52 m) off of the ground and are about 10 feet (3.0 m) apart from each other.\n- Gather small twigs and branches to use for kindling. Kindling needs to be material that will catch easily when you light your tinder.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```pddl\n;; Action 1: search_area\n(:action search_area\n    :parameters (?a - area)\n    :precondition (not (searched ?a))\n    :effect (searched ?a)\n)\n\n;; Action 2: gather_tinder\n(:action gather_tinder\n    :parameters (?t - tinder)\n    :precondition (not (collected ?t))\n    :effect (collected ?t)\n)\n\n;; Action 3: gather_kindling\n(:action gather_kindling\n    :parameters (?k - kindling)\n    :precondition (not (collected ?k))\n    :effect (collected ?k)\n)\n\n;; Action 4: build_teepee\n(:action build_teepee\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?ts - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (searched ?c)\n                    (not (built_teepee ?ts))\n                  )\n    :effect (built_teepee ?ts)\n)\n\n;; Action 5: start_fire\n(:action start_fire\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?ts - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (collected ?t)\n                    (collected ?k)\n                    (built_teepee ?ts)\n                    (not (started_fire ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (started_fire ?c)\n)\n\n;; Action 6: cook\n(:action cook\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?ts - teepee_structure ?cf - campfire)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (started_fire ?c)\n                    (not (cooked ?cf))\n                  )\n    :effect (cooked ?cf)\n)\n\n;; Action 7: build_shelter\n(:action build_shelter\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?ts - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (built_teepee ?ts)\n                    (not (built_shelter ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (built_shelter ?c)\n)\n```\n\nIn this set of PDDL actions, each action is defined with its parameters, preconditions, and effects, following the provided steps and descriptions.

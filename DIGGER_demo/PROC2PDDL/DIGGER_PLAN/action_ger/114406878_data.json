    "Below are the generated PDDL actions for the task \"boil_water\" along with the necessary steps and descriptions:\n\nTask: boil_water\n\nSteps:\n1. cluster_grass npc grass grass_tinder\n2. get_water npc water\n3. start_fire npc camp teepee_structure\n4. break_branch npc bush branch_piece\n5. build_shelter npc camp teepee_structure\n6. cook npc camp teepee_structure campfire\n7. burn_wood person wood\n8. build_teepee npc camp teepee_structure\n\nDescriptions:\n- Search for a source of fresh water.\n- Find small, dry material to use as tinder. Look for dry grass, leaves, tree bark, pine needles, or any other small flammable materials you can find in the area. Tinder needs to be material that is easy to light and will produce a large flame so you can start your fire.\n- Find a branch 10 feet (3.0 m) long and 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) thick. To form your shelter you need a support beam, so look for a sturdy tree branch that isn't rotting. The straighter the branch, the better it will be for forming the structure of your shelter.\n- Use dry sticks, branches, or tree bark to serve as your kindling.\n- Gather small twigs and branches to use for kindling. Kindling needs to be material that will catch easily when you light your tinder.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action cluster_grass\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?g - grass ?t - tinder)\n    :precondition (and (not (clustered ?t)) (gathered ?g))\n    :effect (clustered ?t)\n)\n\n(:action get_water\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?w - water)\n    :precondition (not (collected ?w))\n    :effect (collected ?w)\n)\n\n(:action start_fire\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?t - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and (clustered ?t) (built ?t))\n    :effect (fire_started ?c)\n)\n\n(:action break_branch\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?b - bush ?bp - branch_piece)\n    :precondition (not (broken ?bp))\n    :effect (broken ?bp)\n)\n\n(:action build_shelter\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?t - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and (broken ?bp) (not (built ?t)))\n    :effect (built ?t)\n)\n\n(:action cook\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?t - teepee_structure ?f - campfire)\n    :precondition (fire_started ?c)\n    :effect (cooked ?f)\n)\n\n(:action burn_wood\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - wood)\n    :precondition (gathered ?w)\n    :effect (burned ?w)\n)\n\n(:action build_teepee\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?c - camp ?t - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (not (built ?t))\n    :effect (built ?t)\n)\n```\n\nThese actions encapsulate the steps and descriptions provided, ensuring that the task of boiling water is well-defined in terms of preconditions and effects.",

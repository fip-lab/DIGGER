Jungles are full of tropical fruits and edible plants if you know what to look for. Don\u2019t try eating any plants that you don\u2019t recognize because they could be poisonous.\n- Make a solar water still with a container and a plastic sheet. Dig a hole in an area that receives at least some direct sunlight and put a container, such as a water bottle or can, in the middle of the hole. Fill the space between the sides of the hole and the container with wet leaves. Place a plastic sheet over the top of the hole and put rocks or other heavy objects around the edges to hold it in place. Put a small stone in the middle of the sheet above the container.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Get fruit from the jungle\n(:action get_fruit\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?jungle - jungle ?fruit - fruit)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (in_jungle ?npc ?jungle)\n                    (known_safe_fruit ?fruit)\n                    (located_in ?fruit ?jungle))\n    :effect (and\n              (has_fruit ?npc ?fruit)\n              (not (located_in ?fruit ?jungle)))\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Make a solar water still\n(:action make_solar_still\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?container - container ?plastic_sheet - plastic_sheet ?hole - hole ?leaves - leaves ?rocks - rocks ?stone - stone)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has ?npc ?container)\n                    (has ?npc ?plastic_sheet)\n                    (has ?npc ?leaves)\n                    (has ?npc ?rocks)\n                    (has ?npc ?stone)\n                    (dug_hole ?hole)\n                    (sunlight_area ?hole))\n    :effect (and\n              (solar_still_made ?hole ?container ?plastic_sheet ?leaves ?rocks ?stone)\n              (not (has ?npc ?container))\n              (not (has ?npc ?plastic_sheet))\n              (not (has ?npc ?leaves))\n              (not (has ?npc ?rocks))\n              (not (has ?npc ?stone)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **get_fruit**:\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC, the jungle, and the fruit.\n   - **Preconditions**: The NPC must be in the jungle, the fruit must be known to be safe, and the fruit must be located in the jungle.\n   - **Effects**: The NPC will have the fruit, and the fruit will no longer be located in the jungle.\n\n2. **make_solar_still**:\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC, the container, the plastic sheet, the hole, the leaves, the rocks, and the stone.\n   - **Preconditions**: The NPC must have all the necessary materials (container, plastic sheet, leaves, rocks, and stone), the hole must be dug, and the hole must be in an area with sunlight.\n   - **Effects**: The solar still is made, and the NPC no longer has the materials used to make the solar still.",

You can also leave these items out when it rains to collect the fresh water.\n- Boil water from streams to kill any bacteria. Look for running streams to find fresh water. Filter out any particles through a sock, shirt, or other fabric, then start a fire and boil the water to kill bacteria that can make you sick.\n- Make a 4-pronged bamboo spear to fish with. Find a 6-ft (1.8 m) stalk of bamboo and cut 4- 6 in (15.24 cm) slits into 1 end of it with a knife or sharp rock. Weave a piece of vine into the slits to separate the tip of the bamboo into 4 prongs and sharpen them with a knife or a sharp rock.\n- The plastic sheet will accumulate condensation that will drip down the underside of the sheet and into the container. This water is distilled and safe to drink.\n- Build simple hole-in-the-ground traps to catch animals. Dig a hole in the ground and cover it with something like a large leaf. Put a piece of fruit in the middle as bait. When an animal comes to take the fruit, they will fall in the hole and you can kill it, skin it, and cook it to eat it.\n\nThese PDDL actions capture the steps required to perform the task \"eat_fish\" and align with the provided descriptions.",

The precondition checks if the NPC has the necessary material (wood) and does not already have the tool (drill). The effect is that the NPC now has the drill.\n\n2. **collect_rain_water**: This action allows the NPC to collect rainwater using natural containers found in the rainforest. Preconditions ensure that the NPC is in the rainforest, it is raining, and they have access to natural containers. The effect is that the NPC collects water that is safe to drink.\n\n3. **create_fire**: This action involves starting a fire in the jungle. Preconditions require the NPC to be in the jungle, possess a drill tool, and have access to fuel. The effect is that a fire is started, providing warmth to the NPC."

    "Here are the PDDL actions based on the provided task and steps:\n\nTask: remove_players\n\nSteps:\n- initiate_new_member npc ss\n- set_meeting_location npc ss\n- create_new_member npc ss\n- set_dress_code npc ss\n- teach_new_member_secret adrian ss\n- create_name npc ss\n- create_secret npc ss\n- read_cliques_info npc ss\n\nDescriptions:\n- Conduct a proper initiation for you and your closest friend. This should be done before you initiate others. That way, you are sure to come up with a good idea. The initiation is one of the most important parts of the society. It has to be something neither of you would do normally. Candle-lighting sets a serious and official tone, which is always good. Secret names are fun to have.\n- An important thing in secret societies is to meet in secret, that means meeting in a new place every time or having access to a secret room somewhere. You could even figure out a time to chat online.\n- There needs to be a way to get rid of someone if they become bad for the group or start talking\u2014like blabbing the society's secret. If they do, pretend like that was never the secret, but immediately create a new secret. Put this in the rules.\n- Make a dress code. Most small secret societies use robes while large ones, like the Freemasons, have complex aprons.\n- Initiate well to do people in the society. In a school, initiate the most brilliant and enthusiastic students that seem like clique-material, and they will motivate and inspire others. But you don't want to have too many members. The more members, the less secret it is. Five to ten should be good.\n- Think of a name. You and your closest friend should discuss what your secret society should be called.\n- Create a secret or a secret mission. A secret society must have something to protect.\n- Read a few clique-like books, like the clique series by Lisi Harrison, for some background information, although, maybe not so mean like they were.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```pddl\n(:action initiate_new_member\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (member ?npc ?ss))\n                    (initiation-ready ?ss))\n    :effect (member ?npc ?ss)\n)\n\n(:action set_meeting_location\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?npc ?ss)\n                    (not (location-set ?ss)))\n    :effect (location-set ?ss)\n)\n\n(:action create_new_member\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?npc ?ss)\n                    (not (new-member-created ?npc)))\n    :effect (new-member-created ?npc)\n)\n\n(:action set_dress_code\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?npc ?ss)\n                    (not (dress-code-set ?ss)))\n    :effect (dress-code-set ?ss)\n)\n\n(:action teach_new_member_secret\n    :parameters (?adrian - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?adrian ?ss)\n                    (not (secret-taught ?adrian ?ss)))\n    :effect (secret-taught ?adrian ?ss)\n)\n\n(:action create_name\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?npc ?ss)\n                    (not (name-created ?ss)))\n    :effect (name-created ?ss)\n)\n\n(:action create_secret\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?npc ?ss)\n                    (not (secret-created ?ss)))\n    :effect (secret-created ?ss)\n)\n\n(:action read_cliques_info\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - society)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?npc ?ss)\n                    (not (cliques-info-read ?npc)))\n    :effect (cliques-info-read ?npc)\n)\n```\n\nThese actions capture the intent and logic of each step, ensuring that the necessary conditions are met before performing the actions and defining the resulting changes or outcomes once the actions are completed.",

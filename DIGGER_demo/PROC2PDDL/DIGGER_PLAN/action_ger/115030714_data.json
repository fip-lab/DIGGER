    "Based on the task and steps provided, I'll generate the PDDL actions for the task \"1-cook-food\" with the given step, ensuring it aligns with the descriptions and the overall context of the task.\n\n### Task: 1-cook-food\n\n#### Steps:\n- cook npc kitchen\n\n#### Descriptions:\n- Serve beverages. There are various Japanese-themed drinks you can serve at your party. If it\u2019s a kid\u2019s party, you\u2019ll of course want to stick to non-alcoholic options. If it\u2019s an adult party, you may want to include both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage choices.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the task and the single step, the PDDL action will be focused on cooking food within the kitchen. The description about serving beverages seems to be more of a suggestion for an event or party context and does not directly relate to the cooking task. Hence, we will focus on the cooking aspect.\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action: Cook Food\n(:action cook_food\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?kitchen - location)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?npc ?kitchen)\n      (not (cooked_food ?npc))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (cooked_food ?npc)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- **Action Name**: `cook_food` - This action represents the process of cooking food.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?npc` - The agent or person responsible for cooking.\n  - `?kitchen` - The location where the cooking takes place.\n- **Preconditions**: \n  - The agent (`?npc`) must be at the kitchen location.\n  - The food is not yet cooked (`not (cooked_food ?npc)`).\n- **Effects**: \n  - After the action, the food is considered cooked (`cooked_food ?npc`).\n\nThis action encapsulates the core activity of cooking within the kitchen by the specified agent, aligning with the task's primary focus."

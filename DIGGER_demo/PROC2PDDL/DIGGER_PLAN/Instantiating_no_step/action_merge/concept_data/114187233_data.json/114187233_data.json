    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal action named `shave`, we need to ensure that the new action is general enough to apply to multiple tasks, clear in its state changes, simple and efficient, and logically consistent. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action shave ; Shave or remove the outer layer of an item\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?tool - tool ?surface - surface)\n  :precondition (and \n    (on ?item ?surface)\n    (has_outer_layer ?item)\n    (sharp ?tool)\n    (not (layer_removed ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (layer_removed ?item)\n    (not (has_outer_layer ?item))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?item`, `?tool`, `?surface`) to increase its applicability across different scenarios. The parameters are not limited to specific entities like `coconut` or `knife`, making the action more versatile.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the change in state clearly. The action checks that the item is on a surface, has an outer layer, and the tool is sharp. The effect is that the outer layer is removed.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects from both actions has been retained. The merged action ensures that the item has an outer layer to be removed and the tool used is sharp.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action combines similar effects (i.e., removing the outer layer) into a single, efficient action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied in various contexts where an outer layer needs to be shaved off.\n\nThis merged action `shave` can now be used in various scenarios involving the removal of an outer layer from an object, providing a clear, concise, and general solution.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"slice,\" we need to ensure that the action is general enough to apply to a variety of tasks, clearly describes state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action for \"slice\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action slice\n    :parameters (?item - object ?tool - tool ?surface - surface)\n    :precondition (and (has_outer_layer ?item) (sharp ?tool) (on ?item ?surface))\n    :effect (and (exposed_inner_layer ?item) (not (has_outer_layer ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?item` (object), `?tool` (tool), and `?surface` (surface) to increase applicability across different tasks.\n   - This allows the action to apply to any scenario where an item with an outer layer is sliced using a tool on a surface.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the `?item` has an outer layer, the `?tool` is sharp, and the `?item` is on the `?surface`.\n   - The effect describes that the inner layer of the `?item` is exposed and the outer layer is no longer present.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Retains the essential logic of slicing an item with an outer layer, ensuring the tool must be sharp and the item must be appropriately positioned.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Merges actions with similar effects related to slicing, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n   - Removes unnecessary complexity by using general terms and combining similar actions.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Ensures that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, making the action logically consistent across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"slice\" is adaptable to various tasks while maintaining simplicity, efficiency, and logical consistency.",
    "Given the guidelines and the example actions provided, the primary goal is to create a universal 'turn' action that can be adapted to various tasks involving turning or changing the orientation of items, ensuring the action is both general and efficient. Below is the merged 'turn' action:\n\n### Merged Action: turn\n\n```lisp\n(:action turn ; Turn an item to modify its state\n :parameters (?item - object ?container - object)\n :precondition (and\n   (exposed ?item)\n   (not (turned ?item))\n )\n :effect (and\n   (turned ?item)\n   (in_process ?item ?container)\n )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters `?item` and `?container` to generalize the action for various objects, not limited to coconuts and glasses.\n   - The parameter names are chosen to be broad and adaptable to various contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions include the item being `exposed` and `not (turned ?item)` to reflect that the item must be in a state that allows it to be turned and it hasn\u2019t been turned yet.\n   - The effects ensure the item is now `turned` and is `in_process` with a `?container`, reflecting a state change indicative of a process starting (like draining).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on the core logic required to turn an item and start a process involving another object.\n   - Redundancy is minimized by merging similar effects into a single action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the item is in a state conducive to turning.\n   - The effects maintain a logical transformation of the item\u2019s state, ensuring clarity and reasonability in various contexts.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged 'turn' action remains adaptable, efficient, and logically consistent across different tasks.",
    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action that meets the specified guidelines, we will focus on maintaining generality, expressing clear state changes, avoiding redundancy, and ensuring logical consistency.

    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal \"insert\" action, we need to ensure that it retains the generality, simplicity, and logical consistency required. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action insert ; Insert an item into a structure\n    :parameters (?item - object ?structure1 - structure ?structure2 - structure)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (found ?item)\n                    (has_split ?structure1)\n                    (not (inserted ?item ?structure1))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n             (inserted ?item ?structure1)\n             (horizontal_frame_formed ?item ?structure1 ?structure2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"insert,\" which is generic enough to encompass inserting various types of items into different structures.\n   - Parameters are defined in abstract terms: `?item - object` and `?structure1, ?structure2 - structure`, allowing for broad applicability.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the item is found and the target structure has a split, similar to the original tree-related actions.\n   - Effects denote that the item has been inserted into the structure and that a horizontal frame has been formed, capturing the logical sequence of the two original actions.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The precondition `(found ?item)` captures the essence of needing the item ready for insertion.\n   - `(has_split ?structure1)` ensures the target is ready for insertion.\n   - `(not (inserted ?item ?structure1))` prevents redundant insertions.\n   - The effect `(inserted ?item ?structure1)` reflects the successful insertion, while `(horizontal_frame_formed ?item ?structure1 ?structure2)` captures the outcome of the second action.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By merging similar conditions and effects, redundancy is minimized, creating a streamlined action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring the sequence of actions logically progresses towards the desired state.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable to various tasks involving insertion, while maintaining the integrity and requirements of the original actions.",
    "Here is the merged action based on the provided examples and guidelines:\n\n```lisp\n(:action dig ; Digging action and other related assembly tasks\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?task - task)\n    :precondition (and (not (task_completed ?entity ?task)))\n    :effect (task_completed ?entity ?task)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?task`, making it adaptable to a variety of tasks that involve checking, modifying, or creating states.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change by indicating whether a task has been completed or not.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is simplified by removing redundant complexity and merging similar effects into a single action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be used to represent a wide range of tasks, such as digging a hole, assembling a snare, or any other task that involves transitioning a state from incomplete to complete.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action named \"find,\" we need to ensure that the merged action maintains generality, clearly describes the state change, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Let's proceed with the merger:\n\n**Action Name After Merge: find**\n\n```lisp\n(:action find\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?target - entity)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (found ?target))\n                    (suitable ?target)\n                   )\n    :effect (found ?target)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters `?agent` and `?target`, which can represent any agent or entity, allowing the action to be applied to a variety of tasks.\n   - This abstraction accommodates different contexts such as finding branches, books, or any other suitable target.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(not (found ?target))` ensures that the target has not been found yet and is suitable for finding.\n   - The effect `(found ?target)` indicates that the target has been found, clearly representing the state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids unnecessary complexity by merging similar effects (e.g., finding branches) and using a single abstract representation.\n   - Redundant conditions or effects are eliminated to ensure efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical structure of preconditions and effects is maintained across different contexts, ensuring that the action is reasonable and applicable to various scenarios.\n   - The action is consistent with the notion of \"finding\" something that meets the criteria of being \"suitable.\"\n\nThis universal \"find\" action can now be adapted to different tasks involving the discovery or identification of suitable entities, ensuring broad applicability and simplicity.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal PDDL action that adheres to the specified guidelines, we can focus on creating a generalized \"search\" action. This action should be adaptable to various tasks that involve searching for resources or items and updating the state accordingly.\n\n### Merged Action: `search`\n\n```lisp\n(:action search\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?target - entity ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?agent ?location)\n                  (not (found ?agent ?target))\n                  (search_conditions ?target ?location)\n                )\n  :effect (found ?agent ?target)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The `search` action is designed to be applicable to a variety of tasks involving searching for different resources or items (e.g., water, mushrooms, etc.).\n   - The parameters are abstract and include `?agent` (the person performing the search), `?target` (the entity being searched for), and `?location` (where the search occurs).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the agent is at the location and has not yet found the target.\n   - An additional predicate `search_conditions ?target ?location` is used to capture any specific conditions required for searching particular targets (e.g., the location being dark and damp for mushrooms).\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:**\n   - Redundant actions such as separately searching for water or mushrooms are combined into a single action with abstract parameters and conditions.\n   - The action is kept simple by using general predicates like `found` and `search_conditions`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The logic ensures that the preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, making the action reasonable and adaptable.\n   - The precondition `(at ?agent ?location)` ensures the agent is at the correct location, while `search_conditions` allows for specific conditions to be defined as needed.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible framework for modeling search-related tasks in a PDDL domain, allowing it to be easily extended or adapted for additional search scenarios by defining appropriate `search_conditions` predicates for different targets and locations.",
    "To merge the actions into a single universal action named `pick`, we need to ensure the merged action is general, maintains the core logic of preconditions and effects, and avoids redundancy. Here's how the merged action can be structured:\n\n**Action name after merge:** `pick`\n\n**Merged Action:**\n\n```pddl\n(:action pick\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?source - entity ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?agent ?source)\n      (identifiable ?source)\n      (available ?source ?item)\n      (desirable ?item ?agent)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (picked ?agent ?item)\n      (not (available ?source ?item))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action `pick` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks that involve an agent interacting with a source to obtain an item.\n   - The parameters are abstract: `?agent` (person), `?source` (entity), and `?item` (object). This allows the action to apply to different contexts, such as picking berries, searching for water, or any other resource collection task.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - **Preconditions:**\n     - `(at ?agent ?source)`: The agent must be at the location of the source.\n     - `(identifiable ?source)`: The source must be identifiable.\n     - `(available ?source ?item)`: The item must be available at the source.\n     - `(desirable ?item ?agent)`: The item must be desirable for the agent (e.g., edible, usable, etc.).\n   - **Effects:**\n     - `(picked ?agent ?item)`: The agent successfully picks the item.\n     - `(not (available ?source ?item))`: The item is no longer available at the source.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action combines the logic of picking an item and ensures that the preconditions and effects are simple and efficient.\n   - Redundancy is avoided by using abstract conditions that can represent multiple specific tasks.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts. \n   - The action ensures that the agent can only pick an item if it is available and desirable, reflecting a reasonable state change.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `pick` can be used for a variety of tasks involving resource collection or similar activities, maintaining clarity and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given action sets into a single, universal action named \"collect,\" we need to create an action that generalizes the concept of collecting items or materials while maintaining logical consistency, simplicity, and state change representation.\n\nBelow is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect ; Collect a resource or item\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?resource) (not (collected ?resource)))\n  :effect (collected ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"collect\" uses abstract parameters `?agent` and `?resource`, which can represent any person and object, respectively. This makes the action adaptable to a variety of tasks involving collection.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions check if the resource is available and not yet collected, ensuring that the action represents a clear state change from uncollected to collected.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward, focusing solely on the task of collecting without introducing unnecessary complexity or redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by requiring that the resource is available and not already collected before it can be collected. This ensures the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action effectively captures the essence of the \"collect\" task and can be applied to various scenarios where an agent is responsible for collecting a resource or item."

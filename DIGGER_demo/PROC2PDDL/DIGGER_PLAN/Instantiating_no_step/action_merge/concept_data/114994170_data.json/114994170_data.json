    "To create a universal \"wait\" action by merging the given actions, we'll focus on capturing the core logic of preconditions and effects in a generalized manner while ensuring simplicity and logical consistency. Here is how the merged action could be designed:\n\n### Merged \"wait\" Action\n\n```lisp\n(:action wait\n    ; Wait for a condition to change or for a resource to become available\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?context - situation)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (requires_patience ?context)\n                    (not (resolved ?context)))\n    :effect (resolved ?context)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The merged action is designed to be general by using abstract parameters like `?agent` and `?context`. This allows it to be applied to various situations where waiting is required, such as waiting for chaos to subside or waiting for a resource to become available.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition `(requires_patience ?context)` symbolizes a situation where waiting is necessary, and `(not (resolved ?context))` indicates that the situation is unresolved.\n   - The effect `(resolved ?context)` represents the change in state where the issue or situation has been resolved after the wait.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoidance of Redundancy:**\n   - The merged action is simple and efficient, capturing the essence of waiting without unnecessary complexity.\n   - Redundancy is avoided by abstracting the concept of waiting into a singular precondition and effect applicable to a variety of contexts.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable to different scenarios that involve waiting.\n   - It retains the core logic of situations that require patience and waiting for a resolution.\n\nThis merged action \"wait\" is now capable of adapting to multiple tasks and contexts where waiting is a necessary part of achieving a goal state.",
    "Here's the merged action for the \"collect\" task, based on the provided actions:\n\n### Merged Action: collect\n\n```lisp\n(:action collect ; Collect a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?collector - agent ?source - source ?receptacle - container)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (location ?receptacle at_collection_point)\n                  (location ?source in_collection_point)\n                  (empty ?receptacle)\n                  (resource_available ?source))\n  :effect (and\n            (full ?receptacle)\n            (not (empty ?receptacle)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?collector`, `?source`, `?receptacle`) to increase its applicability to various scenarios involving the collection of resources.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly outline the state transitions. The receptacle starts as `empty` and becomes `full` after the action, ensuring the transformation is explicit.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining the effects and preconditions of both actions into a single, concise action description.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic is maintained consistent across different contexts, with clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis universal \"collect\" action can now be adapted to different collection tasks, making it versatile and efficient for various planning domains.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal action named \"use\" that can be adapted to a variety of tasks, we will follow the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: use\n\n```lisp\n(:action use\n    ; Use a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?resource - resource ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?agent)\n                    (usable ?resource ?context)\n                    (not (in_use ?resource)))\n    :effect (and\n              (in_use ?resource)\n              (not (available ?agent ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - **Parameters**: Abstract parameters `?agent`, `?resource`, and `?context` to make the action adaptable to various scenarios.\n    - **Agent** could be any entity performing the action (person, player, etc.).\n    - **Resource** is the item being used (bathtub, food, etc.).\n    - **Context** provides flexibility to define specific conditions (for example, a crisis situation for eating perishable food).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - **Preconditions**: The agent must be available and the resource must be usable in the given context. It must not already be in use.\n    - **Effects**: The resource becomes in use, and the agent is no longer available for that resource.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - The action is simple and avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters and general conditions.\n    - Ensures efficiency by combining similar effects (e.g., making a resource in use and updating the agent\u2019s availability).\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - Maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects that can be logically applied to different tasks.\n    - Ensures that the action remains consistent across different contexts by defining the general conditions for usage.\n\n### Example Applications:\n\n1. **Use Bathtub to Store Water**:\n    - **Parameters**: `?agent` (person), `?resource` (bathtub), `?context` (water source available).\n    - **Preconditions**: The person is available, the bathtub is usable (empty), and water is available.\n    - **Effects**: The bathtub becomes full (in use), and the person is no longer available for that task.\n\n2. **Eat Perishable Food First**:\n    - **Parameters**: `?agent` (person), `?resource` (perishable food), `?context` (crisis situation).\n    - **Preconditions**: The person is available, the perishable food is usable (edible), and it must not already be consumed.\n    - **Effects**: The perishable food is consumed (in use), and the person is no longer available for that task.\n\nBy merging the actions into the \"use\" action, we create a versatile and adaptable action that can cover a broad range of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states of resources.",
    "Certainly! Let's proceed with merging the given actions into a single universal action named \"eat\". This universal action should be adaptable to various tasks related to consuming food, ensuring it captures and transforms the entity's state effectively.\n\n### Action name after merge: eat\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n- **Action 1**: Eat perishable food first\n```pddl\n(:action eat_perishable_food_first\n    :parameters (?food - food ?storage - refrigerator)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (in_refrigerator ?food ?storage)\n                    (perishable ?food))\n    :effect (and\n              (consumed ?food)\n              (not (in_refrigerator ?food ?storage)))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action eat ; Consume a food item, prioritizing perishables\n    :parameters (?entity - person ?food - food ?storage - storage_location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (in_storage ?food ?storage)\n                    (available ?entity)\n                    (perishable ?food))\n    :effect (and\n              (consumed ?food)\n              (not (in_storage ?food ?storage)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `eat` uses abstract parameters such as `?entity`, `?food`, and `?storage_location`, making it adaptable to various tasks involving different entities, types of food, and storage locations.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, where the food item is removed from storage and marked as consumed.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining the key logic into one action, ensuring the action is simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The logical consistency is maintained by ensuring the preconditions are reasonable (the food is in storage, the entity is available, and the food is perishable) and the effects are clearly defined.\n\n### Example Usage:\nThis merged action can be used in various contexts, such as:\n- A person consuming a perishable food item from a refrigerator.\n- An animal eating food from a designated storage area.\n- Any entity consuming a perishable item from any specified storage location.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `eat` effectively captures the essence of the original actions while enhancing generality, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "To merge the actions \"cover_mouth_and_nose\" and \"place_drop_cloth\" into a single, universal action named \"cover,\" we will abstract the parameters and ensure that the preconditions and effects are generalized and applicable to various contexts. Here\u2019s how the merged action would look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action cover ; Cover an object to change its state\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?covering - item)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (covered ?entity ?covering))\n                    (availability ?covering available))\n    :effect (and\n             (covered ?entity ?covering)\n             (availability ?covering in_use))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?entity` and `?covering`, allowing the action to be applied to various entities and covering items, not just characters or specific items like drop cloths.\n   \n2. **State Change**: \n   - The precondition checks if the entity is not yet covered and if the covering item is available. The effects then reflect the state change where the entity becomes covered, and the covering item is marked as in use.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - By removing specific conditions like `location` or `safety_level`, the action becomes simpler and more universally applicable without losing its core logic of covering an entity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that it only operates if the entity is not already covered and the item is available, thus maintaining reasonable preconditions and effects across different scenarios.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various contexts where an object needs to be covered, whether it's for protection, concealment, or any other task that requires covering an entity with an item.",
    "Certainly! Below is the merged action for the provided tasks, which combines the `find_shelter` and `travel_to_home` actions into a single, more abstract action named `find`.\n\n### Action Name after Merge: find\n\n#### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action find\n    ; Find a location and update the entity's state\n    :parameters (?npc - character ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and\n                   (location ?npc outside) \n                   (safety_level ?npc protected)\n                   (knowledge ?npc location))\n    :effect (and\n             (location ?npc ?location)\n             (safety_level ?npc more_protected))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `find` uses abstract parameters like `?npc` for the entity and `?location` for the place, making it adaptable to various tasks involving finding a location.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state:\n    - Preconditions specify that the entity is `outside`, has a `protected` safety level, and possesses `knowledge` of the location.\n    - Effects describe the entity moving to the `?location` and having a `more_protected` safety level.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable for the context of finding a location and updating the entity's state.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `find` is both adaptable to various tasks and maintains a clear and logical structure.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions related to traveling and entering a home, we aim to create a universal action that maintains the core logic, state change, and generality, while avoiding redundancy. The merged action should be adaptable to different contexts involving travel and entry processes.

    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"purify,\" we need to ensure that the action is adaptable to various contexts involving the purification process. We'll use abstract parameters, clearly define state changes, and maintain logical consistency.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action purify ; Purify a resource and prepare it for use\n  :parameters (?resource - entity ?c - container ?tool - tool)\n  :precondition (and\n    (unprocessed ?resource)\n    (available ?c)\n    (has_tool ?tool)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (processed ?c)\n    (not (unprocessed ?resource))\n    (not (available ?c))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"purify\" to capture the essence of transforming a resource into a usable state.\n   - The parameters are abstract (`?resource`, `?c`, `?tool`) to apply to various tasks, whether purifying water, filtering substances, or similar processes.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions involve checking if the resource is unprocessed, the container is available, and the necessary tool is present.\n   - The effects reflect the transition of the container into a processed state and the resource no longer being unprocessed, with the container no longer being available for further operations.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action merges similar effects from boiling and filtering processes into a single transformation step, avoiding redundant operations.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the necessary conditions are met before the action is executed, while effects logically follow from the action's purpose.\n   - This structure ensures the action is applicable across different purifying contexts, maintaining consistency and clarity in its logic.",
    "Here is the merged action for the given tasks, named `boil`:\n\n```lisp\n(:action boil ; Boil a container's contents and update its status\n    :parameters (?c - container)\n    :precondition (and\n      (purified ?c)\n      (not (boiled ?c))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (boiled ?c)\n      (not (purified ?c))\n    )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters to maintain general applicability. Here, the parameter `?c` is a container, which can be any container in different contexts.\n- **State Change**: The action clearly describes the state change: the container must be purified before it can be boiled, and once boiled, it is no longer in the purified state.\n- **Core Logic**: The preconditions and effects are straightforward and reflect the necessary state transformations without unnecessary complexity.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action merges the state changes related to boiling water, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that a container must be purified before being boiled, and it updates the state appropriately.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various scenarios where boiling a container's contents is required, and it efficiently captures the necessary state transformations.",
    "To merge the given actions into a universal \"gather\" action, we need to capture the essence of gathering entities and updating their state to reflect that they are now part of a collection or kit. This involves generalizing the parameters and ensuring the preconditions and effects clearly represent the state change. Here's how you can merge the given actions into a single \"gather\" action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action gather ; Gather a resource and integrate it into a collection\n    :parameters (?resource - entity ?collection - collection)\n    :precondition (and\n      (gatherable ?resource)\n      (not (in_collection ?resource ?collection))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (in_collection ?resource ?collection)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters `?resource` and `?collection` are abstract enough to represent any entity and collection, respectively, making the action adaptable across various contexts and tasks.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the `?resource` is gatherable and not already in the `?collection`, capturing the initial state.\n   - The effect updates the state to reflect that the `?resource` is now part of the `?collection`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action is simple and removes unnecessary specifics, focusing solely on the gathering and inclusion process.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the resource can only be added if it is gatherable and not already included in the collection, maintaining clarity across different tasks.",
    "To create a merged action named \"build\" that encompasses the described tasks related to building a first aid kit and purifying water, we need to abstract the parameters and define a general process that can cover the various sub-tasks. Here is how the merged action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action build ; Build or assemble a resource\n    :parameters (?entity - resource ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and\n        (not (complete ?entity))\n        (requires_action ?entity ?state)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (complete ?entity)\n        (not (requires_action ?entity ?state))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?state`, where `?entity` can represent any resource (e.g., a first aid kit, water) and `?state` can represent the current state of that resource (e.g., unpurified water, incomplete kit).\n   - This allows the action to be adaptable to various tasks that involve building or completing a resource.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks that the entity is not yet complete and that it requires a specific action given its current state.\n   - The effect marks the entity as complete and removes the requirement for further action, indicating a successful transformation of the entity's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action is concise and avoids redundancy by using a single set of preconditions and effects that can apply to multiple scenarios.\n   - This ensures efficiency and simplicity while still capturing the necessary logic for the tasks.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical structure ensures that the preconditions and effects are reasonable across different contexts, maintaining consistency in the logic applied to building or assembling resources. \n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of contexts, such as building a first aid kit or purifying water, by appropriately defining the `?entity` and `?state` for each specific task."

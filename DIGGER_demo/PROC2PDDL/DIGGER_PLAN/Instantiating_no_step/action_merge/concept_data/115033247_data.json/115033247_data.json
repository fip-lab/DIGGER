    "To effectively merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"obtain,\" we need to abstract the parameters and ensure the action is general enough to apply to a variety of tasks. The merged action should clearly define the state changes, retain the core logic, avoid redundancy, and maintain logical consistency. Below is how the merged action can be structured:\n\n### Merged Action: Obtain\n\n```lisp\n(:action obtain\n  ; Obtain a resource and change its state or location\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?location1 - place ?location2 - place)\n  :precondition (and (available ?entity) (at ?entity ?location1))\n  :effect (and (obtained ?entity) (at ?entity ?location2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters such as `?entity`, `?location1`, and `?location2`. This allows it to apply to various entities and locations, not just specific types like papyrus or a nursery.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition requires that the entity is available and at a specific location (`?location1`). The effect reflects that the entity is now obtained and has moved to a new location (`?location2`).\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of checking if the entity is available and its location, then updating its state to \"obtained\" and changing its location, is preserved.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By using generic parameters and effects, the merged action avoids redundancy and remains simple and efficient.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring they hold true for any type of object or location.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted for various tasks involving obtaining or moving different types of resources or objects within different environments.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action named \"peel\" that combines the essential elements of the provided actions, we need to ensure it is general, reflects state changes clearly, and avoids redundancy while maintaining logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: peel\n```lisp\n(:action peel\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?tool - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (obtained ?entity) \n                       (intact ?entity outer_layer) \n                       (sharp ?tool) \n                       (at ?tool ?location) \n                       (at ?entity ?location))\n    :effect (and (not (intact ?entity outer_layer)) \n                 (peeled ?entity outer_layer) \n                 (exposed ?entity inner_part))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (?entity, ?tool, ?location) to ensure the action can apply to various objects beyond just papyrus and knives.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the entity's state from having an intact outer layer to being peeled and exposing the inner part.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids unnecessary complexity by focusing on the essential conditions and resulting state changes.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied in different contexts where peeling an outer layer is required.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable for tasks involving the peeling of various entities, provided the right conditions (preconditions) are met for the action to take place."

    "Combining the provided actions into a single universal action for collecting resources, while following the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we get the following merged PDDL action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect ; Collect a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?a - agent ?r - resource ?l - location)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?r ?l)\n    (in ?a main_area)\n    (not (collected ?r))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (collected ?r)\n    (not (at ?r ?l))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Action Name:** The action is named `collect`, reflecting its purpose of collecting various resources.\n- **Parameters:** The parameters are `?a` (agent), `?r` (resource), and `?l` (location). This ensures the action is adaptable to different types of resources and locations.\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - `(at ?r ?l)`: The resource must be at the specified location.\n  - `(in ?a main_area)`: The agent must be in the main area to perform the collection.\n  - `(not (collected ?r))`: The resource should not have been collected already.\n- **Effects:**\n  - `(collected ?r)`: The resource is now marked as collected.\n  - `(not (at ?r ?l))`: The resource is no longer at the original location.\n\nThis merged action maintains simplicity by avoiding unnecessary complexity, ensuring logical consistency, and being adaptable to a variety of tasks involving different types of resources.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal \"gather\" action, we need to ensure it is abstract enough to cover a variety of tasks while maintaining a clear state transformation logic. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action gather\n  :parameters (?a - agent ?i - item ?l - location)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?i ?l)\n    (in ?a main_area)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (collected ?i)\n    (not (at ?i ?l))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"gather\" to reflect the general task of collecting items.\n   - Abstract parameters (`?a`, `?i`, `?l`) are used to ensure the action can apply to various agents, items, and locations.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions specify that the item must be at a specific location (`at ?i ?l`) and the agent must be in the main area (`in ?a main_area`).\n   - The effect indicates that the item has been collected (`collected ?i`) and is no longer at the original location (`not (at ?i ?l)`).\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n   - Redundancies are avoided by using a single \"gather\" action that encapsulates the logic of collecting items from different locations, eliminating the need for multiple similar actions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical flow is consistent as it reflects the action of gathering or collecting an item, which is applicable across different scenarios and maintains reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action effectively combines the logic of the original actions into a single, versatile action that adheres to the guidelines provided.",
    "To merge the actions into a single, universal action named \"lay\" that is adaptable to various tasks, we need to generalize parameters, identify core logic, ensure logical consistency, and avoid redundancy. Here's how we can achieve that:\n\n```pddl\n(:action lay ; Lay a resource and update its state\n    :parameters (?resource - object ?agent - player)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?resource) (ready ?agent))\n    :effect (and (utilized ?resource) (not (prepared ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?resource` and `?agent` to apply to various objects and agents, not just specific items like tape or food.\n   - The preconditions use general predicates like `prepared` and `ready` instead of specific conditions like `rolled` or `selected`, allowing for broader applicability.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(prepared ?resource)` implies that the resource is in a state ready for the action.\n   - The effect `(utilized ?resource)` indicates a transformation in the resource's state, capturing the essence of actions like unrolling tape or utilizing a food item.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoidance of Redundancy**:\n   - Redundant conditions and effects are removed for simplicity. The merged action focuses on the core logic of preparing and utilizing resources.\n   - Conditions like `(not (prepared ?resource))` ensure that the resource's state is updated without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action `lay` maintains consistent logic that can be applied across different tasks involving resource manipulation.\n   - Preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable for various contexts, ensuring logical consistency.\n\nThis merged action \"lay\" can be adapted to different scenarios by defining specific instances of `?resource` and `?agent`, while maintaining the core logic of checking preconditions and applying effects."

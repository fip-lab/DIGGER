    "To create a merged action named `approach` that maintains generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can abstract the parameters and effects to apply to various tasks. The merged action will be designed to handle different scenarios involving approaching a target entity.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action approach ; Approach a target and update entity location\n  :parameters (?entity - agent ?location1 - place ?location2 - place ?target - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?entity ?location1)\n                  (at ?target ?location2)\n                  (location-clear ?location2))\n  :effect (and\n            (at ?entity ?location2)\n            (not (at ?entity ?location1))\n            (not (location-clear ?location2))\n           )\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** The parameters `?entity`, `?location1`, `location2`, and `?target` are abstract, allowing the action to be used in different contexts where an entity approaches a target at a specific location.\n2. **State Change:** The precondition checks if the entity is at the initial location (`?location1`) and the target is at the destination location (`?location2`). The location must be clear (`location-clear ?location2`). The effect updates the entity's location to the target's location and marks the location as no longer clear.\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is straightforward with no unnecessary complexity, ensuring efficiency.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain logical consistency across different contexts. The state change is clearly reflected, transforming the entity's state from the initial location to the target location.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various scenarios involving approaching a target, such as a person approaching a ship, a robot approaching a station, or any agent moving from one place to another while considering the target's location and the destination's status.",
    "To merge the given action sets into a single universal action with the name \"board,\" we need to generalize the parameters, preconditions, and effects to capture the essence of the boarding operation. Here's how the merged action can look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action board ; Board an entity and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - person ?transport - vehicle)\n  :precondition (and \n                 (at ?entity ?transport)\n                 (ready ?transport))\n  :effect (and \n           (on-board ?entity ?transport)\n           (not (at ?entity ?transport)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters have been generalized to `?entity - person` and `?transport - vehicle` to apply to various boarding scenarios, not just ships.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the entity's state. The entity starts \"at\" the transport and, once the action is executed, is \"on-board\" the transport.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions (checking the entity's location and the transport's readiness) and effects (updating the entity's location) is retained without unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Similar effects are merged efficiently to ensure simplicity.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain reasonable logic across different contexts, ensuring clarity and consistency.\n\nThis merged action should sufficiently cover the essence of the boarding process across various types of tasks involving different entities and vehicles.",
    "(:action hold ; Hold onto an item or support for stability\n  :parameters (?p - person ?s - support)\n  :precondition (and (near ?p ?s) (not (holding ?p ?s)))\n  :effect (holding ?p ?s))\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `hold` can be applied to various contexts where a person might need to hold onto something for support or stability, not limited to holding rails on a ship.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition ensures the person is near the support and not already holding it, while the effect reflects the change in state where the person is now holding the support.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action is simple and avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core logic of holding an item for stability.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, making it adaptable to various tasks involving holding onto different types of support.",
    "Here's how the merged action \"secure\" might look, based on the principles and examples you've provided:\n\n```pddl\n(:action secure ; Secure a component and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?entity ?location) (not (secured ?entity)))\n  :effect (secured ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action \"secure\" uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?location`, making it adaptable to various contexts beyond just securing legs on a ship. It could apply to any scenario where an entity needs to be secured at a location.\n\n- **State Change:** The precondition `(at ?entity ?location)` ensures that the entity is in the correct place before securing it. The effect `(secured ?entity)` indicates the change in state, marking the entity as secured.\n\n- **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:** The merged action removes any unnecessary complexity by focusing on the core logic of securing an entity and ensuring its presence at a location, avoiding redundant preconditions or effects.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, maintaining logical consistency across different tasks and contexts.",
    "(:action stabilize ; Stabilize an entity and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?stabilizer - person ?context - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (legs-secured ?stabilizer)\n                  (holding-rail ?stabilizer)\n                  (in-context ?stabilizer ?context))\n  :effect (and\n            (stable ?entity)\n            (centered ?stabilizer)\n            (crouched ?stabilizer))\n)",

It abstracts the parameters to `?a` for agent and `?item` for any object, increasing its applicability.\n\n2. **State Change:** The precondition ensures that the agent is available and has not already used the item. The effect updates the state to reflect that the agent has used the item and now knows how to use it.\n\n3. **Core Logic:** The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity. The action's precondition checks the availability and usage status of the item, and the effect updates the state to reflect its usage and the agent's knowledge about it.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:** Similar effects from the original actions are combined to ensure simplicity and efficiency. Both actions involve changing the status of an item and updating the agent's capability.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts. It ensures that the agent's availability and usage status are considered before updating the state, maintaining logical consistency.\n\nBy merging the actions into this universal `use` action, the resulting action is versatile, simple, and logically consistent across different scenarios.",

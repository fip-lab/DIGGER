    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action called `stock`, we need to create a generalized, efficient, and logically consistent action that can adapt to different contexts of stocking and preparing items. Below is the merged action, taking into account the parameters, preconditions, and effects of the given actions:\n\n### Merged Action: stock\n```lisp\n(:action stock\n  ; Universal action for stocking and preparing items\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and (available ?agent) (separate ?item) (not (ready ?item)))\n  :effect (and (stored ?item) (ready ?item) (processed ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name:** `stock` - A general name that can apply to various stocking and preparation tasks.\n- **Parameters:** \n  - `?agent - agent` - A generalized agent performing the action.\n  - `?item - object` - A generalized item being stocked or prepared.\n- **Preconditions:** \n  - `(available ?agent)` - The agent must be available to perform the action.\n  - `(separate ?item)` - The item must be in a separate state before stocking.\n  - `(not (ready ?item))` - The item must not be in a ready state before the action.\n- **Effects:** \n  - `(stored ?item)` - The item is stored after the action.\n  - `(ready ?item)` - The item is ready after the action.\n  - `(processed ?item)` - The item is processed during the stocking action.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of both stocking non-perishable food and preparing items for survival plans, providing a flexible and adaptable action that can be used in various contexts. The preconditions ensure that the item is in the correct state before stocking, and the effects clearly reflect the changes in the item's state after the action.",
    "Here's the merged action for the \"make\" task, following the guidelines provided:\n\n```pddl\n(:action make ; Create a plan or prepare an entity\n    :parameters (?entity - object)\n    :precondition (and (not (prepared ?entity)))\n    :effect (and (prepared ?entity) (state-at-ease ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** The merged action is designed to be applicable to a variety of scenarios where an entity needs to be prepared or a plan needs to be created. The parameter `?entity` is kept abstract to accommodate different types of objects or tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:** The precondition checks whether the entity is not yet prepared, ensuring that the action is only applicable when preparation is necessary. The effect clearly indicates the transition of the entity to a prepared state and adds a state of ease, reflecting a completed plan or preparation.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The action removes any unnecessary complexity by focusing solely on the preparation or planning aspect. The parameters and state transitions are kept minimal and clear.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring that the action only applies when preparation is needed and results in a clear, logical state change. The use of `prepared` and `state-at-ease` captures the essential outcome of making a plan or preparing an entity."

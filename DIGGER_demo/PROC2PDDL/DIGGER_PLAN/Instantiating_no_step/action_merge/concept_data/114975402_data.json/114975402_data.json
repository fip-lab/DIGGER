    "Given your guidelines and the example actions for the `find` task, I'll proceed to merge the actions related to finding supplies and clean clothing into a single universal `find` action.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n**Action name after merge:** find\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n```\n(:action find_supplies ; Find supplies and update the person's inventory\n    :parameters (?p - person ?s - supply)\n    :precondition (and (not (has-supply ?p ?s)))\n    :effect (has-supply ?p ?s)\n)\n\n(:action find_clean_clothing ; Find clean clothing and update the person's inventory\n    :parameters (?p - person ?c - clothing)\n    :precondition (and (not (has-clothing ?p ?c)))\n    :effect (has-clothing ?p ?c)\n)\n```\n\n**The actions after the merger are:**\n```\n(:action find ; Find an item and update the person's inventory\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (not (has-item ?p ?item)))\n    :effect (has-item ?p ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged `find` action uses abstract parameters `?p` for person and `?item` for object, making it applicable to various tasks involving finding different types of items.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition ensures that the person does not already have the item, and the effect updates the person's inventory to reflect that they now have the item.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into a single, straightforward action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are kept simple and logical, ensuring consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving finding and acquiring items, maintaining your guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named `clean`, we need to ensure that it captures the core logic, state changes, and maintains generality and simplicity. Here is how we can achieve this:\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action clean\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has-supply ?agent ?item)\n                    (dirty ?item))\n    :effect (and\n             (not (dirty ?item))\n             (clean ?item))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action `clean` is generalized to apply to any `person` and `object`, making it adaptable to various tasks involving cleaning.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the change in state. If an item is dirty and the agent has the necessary supply, the action can be performed to clean the item.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects from the original actions is retained. If the agent has the necessary supply and the item is dirty, performing the action will remove the dirty condition and add the clean condition.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action eliminates redundancy by combining similar effects into a single set of preconditions and effects.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `clean` is simple, efficient, and adaptable to a variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating clean states for items.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action for \"camouflage\" based on the provided example, we need to ensure that the action can be applied to a variety of tasks related to camouflaging items. Here\u2019s how we can design the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: Camouflage\n\n```lisp\n(:action camouflage ; Camouflage an item by transforming its state\n    :parameters (?p - person ?i - item)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has-supply ?p ?i)\n                    (not (camouflaged ?i)))\n    :effect (and\n             (not (bare ?i))\n             (camouflaged ?i))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"camouflage,\" which is broad and not limited to specific types of items or contexts.\n   - Parameters are abstract (`?p` for person and `?i` for item), allowing the action to be applied to various scenarios involving different objects.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the person has the item and that the item is not already camouflaged.\n   - Effects show a clear state transformation: the item is no longer bare and becomes camouflaged.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action merges similar effects (e.g., making an item camouflaged) into a single coherent effect, avoiding redundancy.\n   - Unnecessary complexity is removed, maintaining a focus on the state change from bare to camouflaged.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logic is consistent across different tasks: if an item is not camouflaged and is available, it can be camouflaged.\n   - Preconditions and effects are reasonable and clear, ensuring the action's applicability in various contexts.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action \"camouflage\" is efficient, adaptable, and maintains logical consistency across different scenarios and tasks.",
    "Here is a merged action for the task of assembling disguises, combining the example actions into a single universal action named `make`. This action captures the essence of creating a disguise by making necessary state changes with respect to supplies, clothing, and helmet visibility:\n\n```pddl\n(:action make ; Create or modify an element to achieve a desired state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?state - state)\n  :precondition (and\n                 (has-supply ?p ?item)\n                 (not (in-state ?item ?state)))\n  :effect (and\n           (not (in-state ?item (opposite ?state)))\n           (in-state ?item ?state))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** The action uses abstract parameters (`?p`, `?item`, `?state`) to apply to various tasks involving making or modifying elements, such as making a helmet invisible or clothing clean. The `?state` parameter allows for flexible specification of the desired state, such as `helmet-invisible`, `clean`, etc.\n\n2. **State Change:** The precondition ensures that the person has the necessary supply and that the item is not already in the desired state. The effect transitions the item from its opposite state (if applicable) to the desired state, reflecting a clear state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by using a generic `in-state` predicate to capture the desired outcomes without needing separate actions for each specific state change, such as visibility or cleanliness.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The precondition and effect logic maintains consistency across various contexts by ensuring that the item is modified only if it's in the opposite state of what is desired, making the action applicable to a wide range of scenarios.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable and can be used for tasks beyond just disguises by simply defining what `?state` represents in different contexts."

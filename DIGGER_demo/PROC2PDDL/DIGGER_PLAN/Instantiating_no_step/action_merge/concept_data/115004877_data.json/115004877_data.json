    "Given the tasks and actions provided, we can merge the actions into a single universal action that is general, state-changing, simple, and logically consistent. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Universal Action: Transform\n\n```lisp\n(:action transform ; General action to transform an entity's state\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?resource - object ?tool - object)\n    :precondition (and (available ?entity) (required_for ?task ?resource ?entity) (not (transformed ?entity)))\n    :effect (and (transformed ?entity) (used ?resource ?tool))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action `transform` is abstract and can be adapted to various tasks involving different entities, resources, and tools.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the entity is available and that the required resource for the task is available.\n   - The effect clearly describes the transformation of the entity's state and the use of the resource with the tool.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects from different actions into a single `transformed` effect.\n   - It uses abstract parameters to maintain simplicity and applicability to various contexts.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different tasks, ensuring that the action can be applied in diverse scenarios.\n   \n### Example Contexts for `transform`:\n\n1. **Replace Linen:**\n\n```lisp\n(:action transform\n    :parameters (?linen - linen ?papyrus - papyrus ?drying_tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and (wet ?linen) (covering ?papyrus ?linen) (not (transformed ?linen)))\n    :effect (and (transformed ?linen) (used ?papyrus ?drying_tool))\n)\n```\n\n2. **Polish Papyrus:**\n\n```lisp\n(:action transform\n    :parameters (?papyrus - papyrus ?shell - shell ?ivory - ivory)\n    :precondition (and (not (polished ?papyrus)) (smooth ?shell ?ivory) (not (transformed ?papyrus)))\n    :effect (and (transformed ?papyrus) (used ?shell ?ivory))\n)\n```\n\n3. **Flatten Sheet:**\n\n```lisp\n(:action transform\n    :parameters (?sheet - sheet ?stone_slab - slab ?flattening_tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and (not (flat ?sheet)) (available ?stone_slab) (not (transformed ?sheet)))\n    :effect (and (transformed ?sheet) (used ?stone_slab ?flattening_tool))\n)\n```\n\nThis universal `transform` action can be easily adapted to various tasks by specifying the appropriate parameters, making it a versatile and efficient approach to capturing and transforming states in different contexts.",
    "Given the guidelines and the example actions, the goal is to create a merged action that can address both \"lay-strips-on-surface\" and \"dip-strips-into-glue-and-water-mixture\" actions into a single, abstract action. Here is the merged action that can be used for both laying the strips on a surface and dipping them into a glue and water mixture while ensuring generality, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action lay\n  :parameters (?item - object ?destination - location)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (not (on ?item ?destination))\n                  (not (in ?item ?destination))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n            (on ?item ?destination)\n            (in ?item ?destination)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?item` and `?destination` to apply to various tasks involving laying or dipping objects. The parameters `?item` and `?destination` are defined as `object` and `location` respectively, making the action adaptable to various contexts.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the item is neither on nor in the destination. The effects clearly state that the item will be placed on or in the destination, capturing the state change.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simple and avoids redundancy by combining the core logic of both actions, ensuring efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable, ensuring that the item is placed correctly in various contexts.\n\nThis merged action should be able to handle tasks related to laying and dipping objects, transforming their state appropriately while maintaining simplicity and generality.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action called `dip` that can represent a variety of tasks involving dipping or submerging an object into a mixture or liquid, we can follow the guidelines provided. We'll ensure the action is general, captures the state change effectively, is simple, and logically consistent. Here is how the merged action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action dip\n  ; Dip an item into a mixture or liquid and update its state\n  :parameters (?item - object ?mixture - substance)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (not (dipped ?item ?mixture))\n                  (suitable_for_dipping ?item)\n                )\n  :effect (dipped ?item ?mixture)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?item` and `?mixture` are abstract enough to apply to various tasks involving dipping objects into substances. By using `object` and `substance`, we increase the action's applicability.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition checks that the item has not yet been dipped into the mixture and that it is suitable for dipping. The effect updates the state to reflect that the item is now dipped.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward, with no unnecessary complexity. We avoid redundancy by ensuring the preconditions and effects are minimal and directly related to the task.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The precondition `suitable_for_dipping` ensures logical consistency, as it checks whether the item is appropriate for the action, avoiding situations where unsuitable items might be dipped. The effect clearly states the result of the action.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `dip` is adaptable to a variety of scenarios where dipping is involved, maintaining clarity and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action that adheres to the guidelines, we need to abstract the parameters and ensure that the preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different tasks. Here's the merged action \"peel\" which combines peeling, polishing, and any other similar tasks:\n\n```lisp\n(:action peel ;  Perform a transformation on a resource, such as peeling, polishing, or flattening\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?tool1 - object ?tool2 - object)\n  :precondition (and (obtained ?entity) (not (transformed ?entity)) (smooth ?tool1) (smooth ?tool2))\n  :effect (and (transformed ?entity) (not (outer-layer-intact ?entity)) (inner-part-exposed ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?entity`, `?tool1`, and `?tool2` are abstract, allowing this action to be applied to various objects and tools beyond just papyrus, shell, and ivory.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(obtained ?entity)` ensures that the entity is available for transformation. The state change is reflected by the `:effect` where the entity is now transformed, the outer layer is no longer intact, and the inner part is exposed.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoid Redundancy**: By generalizing the parameters and merging similar effects, the action remains simple and avoids redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts, ensuring that the action's logic holds irrespective of the specific task.\n\nThis merged action \"peel\" can now be used to handle various tasks involving the transformation of entities, such as peeling, polishing, or flattening, in a consistent and efficient manner.",
    "To merge the \"cut\" actions while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to ensure that the merged action can handle different types of cutting tasks. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n### Action name after merge: cut\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n```pddl\n(:action cut-stalks\n    :parameters (?p - papyrus)\n    :precondition (and (inner-part-exposed ?p) (stalks-intact ?p))\n    :effect (and (not (stalks-intact ?p)) (stalks-cut ?p))\n)\n```\n\n### The actions after the merger are:\n```pddl\n(:action cut ; Universal action to cut an item and update its state\n    :parameters (?cutter - agent ?item - object ?part - object-part)\n    :precondition (and (can-cut ?cutter ?item) (part-intact ?item ?part))\n    :effect (and (not (part-intact ?item ?part)) (part-cut ?item ?part))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action is now applicable to any scenario where cutting is involved, using abstract parameters like `?cutter`, `?item`, and `?part` to generalize different cutting tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, from `part-intact` to `part-cut`.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy and complexity by focusing on the essential logic of cutting an item.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable preconditions (the cutter can cut the item and the part is intact) and effects (the part is no longer intact and is cut) across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various scenarios where cutting tasks are involved, ensuring it is adaptable, simple, and efficient.",
    "The task of merging multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action involves creating an action that is abstract enough to cover a variety of specific tasks while maintaining clarity and logical consistency. Given the guidelines and examples provided, we will create a merged action named `flatten` that can be applied to various tasks involving the concept of \"flattening.\"\n\nHere are the actions to be merged:\n\n1. **Flatten-Sheet**\n```pddl\n(:action flatten-sheet\n    :parameters (?s - sheet ?slab - stone-slab)\n    :precondition (and (not (flat ?s)) (available ?slab))\n    :effect (and (flat ?s) (not (available ?slab)))\n)\n```\n\n2. **Replace Wet Linen Sheets**\n```pddl\n(:action replace-wet-linen-sheets\n    :parameters (?linen - linen ?dry-linen - linen ?rack - rack)\n    :precondition (and (wet ?linen) (available ?dry-linen) (in ?linen ?rack))\n    :effect (and (not (wet ?linen)) (dry ?linen) (not (available ?dry-linen)) (available ?rack))\n)\n```\n\nTo create a merged action named `flatten`, we need to generalize the parameters and combine the preconditions and effects from both actions while ensuring that the new action is abstract and adaptable to various tasks:\n\n**Merged Action: `flatten`**\n```pddl\n(:action flatten\n    :parameters (?item1 - object ?item2 - object ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and (not (flat ?item1)) (available ?resource))\n    :effect (and (flat ?item1) (not (available ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action `flatten` can be applied to a variety of tasks involving the concept of making an object flat using a resource. The parameters are generalized to `?item1`, `?item2`, and `?resource` to increase the applicability of the action. The preconditions and effects are combined in a way that ensures logical consistency and simplicity without redundancy.\n\nLet's break down how this merged action accommodates the original actions:\n\n- The parameter `?item1` represents the object to be flattened (e.g., a sheet or linen).\n- The parameter `?resource` represents the resource needed to perform the flattening (e.g., a stone slab or a rack).\n- The precondition `(not (flat ?item1))` ensures that the item to be flattened is not already flat.\n- The effect `(flat ?item1)` indicates the item has been flattened.\n- The precondition `(available ?resource)` ensures the resource is available for the task.\n- The effect `(not (available ?resource))` indicates the resource is no longer available after the task is completed.\n\nBy following the guidelines and combining the actions logically, we create a single, universal action that is both abstract and adaptable to a variety of tasks involving flattening."

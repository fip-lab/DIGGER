    "To merge the actions into a single universal action named \"gather,\" we need to consider the abstract parameters that can accommodate different entities involved in gathering activities. The merged action should encapsulate the essence of gathering various resources while ensuring simplicity, logical consistency, and a clear depiction of state changes.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action gather\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?resource - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (at ?agent ?location)\n                    (available ?resource ?location)\n                    (not (gathered ?agent ?resource)))\n    :effect (and\n              (gathered ?agent ?resource)\n              (not (available ?resource ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - Uses abstract parameters `?agent`, `?resource`, and `?location` to apply to a wide variety of gathering tasks, whether it's tinder, water, or driftwood.\n   - `?resource` and `?location` are general enough to cover different types of objects and places involved in gathering.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions check if the agent is at the location and if the resource is available there.\n   - Effects ensure that the resource has been gathered and is no longer available at the location.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - Merged similar preconditions and effects from the original actions into a single set of logical conditions.\n   - Eliminated unnecessary complexity by using the `gathered` predicate to represent the completion of a gathering task.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the action's preconditions and effects make sense across different contexts where gathering might occur. \n\nThis universal \"gather\" action can be adapted to different tasks involving collecting resources, providing a simple and efficient means to model these activities in a PDDL planning domain.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named `create`, we need to focus on abstracting the parameters and maintaining the core logic of preconditions and effects while ensuring general applicability. Here's how the merged action would look like:\n\n```pddl\n(:action create ; Create a resource or state change\n    :parameters (?entity - agent ?resource - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (at ?entity ?location)\n                    (available ?resource ?location)\n                    (not (created ?resource ?location))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (created ?resource ?location)\n              (not (available ?resource ?location))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named `create`, which is a general term applicable to many tasks like creating a spark, shelter, fire, or smoke signal.\n   - Parameters are abstracted to `?entity - agent`, `?resource - object`, and `?location - place` to accommodate various scenarios.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the entity is at the location and the resource is available but not yet created in the desired state.\n   - Effects update the resource state to `created`, representing the successful completion of the task.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action combines similar logic from the original actions, such as creating a spark, building a shelter, or starting a fire, into a single, streamlined action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are aligned across different contexts, ensuring logical consistency and applicability to a variety of tasks.\n\nBy abstracting the parameters and combining the core logic, this merged action can apply to multiple situations where an entity creates or transforms a resource into a new state at a specific location.",
    "(:action light ; Light a resource and update its state\n:parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - flammable)\n:precondition (and (spark_created ?resource) (not (lit ?resource)))\n:effect (lit ?resource))",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal \"scavenge\" action, we need to follow the guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Below is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action scavenge ; Scavenge resources and update task status\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?location - area ?resource - resource_type)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?location)\n                    (available ?resource ?location)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (collected ?agent ?resource)\n              (not (available ?resource ?location))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action \"scavenge\" uses abstract parameters `?agent`, `?location`, and `?resource`, making it adaptable to various scavenging tasks. This allows it to apply to different types of resources and locations, not limited to floating items or water sources.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions require that the agent is at the location and that the resource is available at that location.\n   - The effect reflects the change by marking the resource as collected by the agent and no longer available at the location, indicating a successful scavenging action.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining the logic of checking for resource availability and collecting it into a single action, simplifying the overall PDDL structure.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent, ensuring that the action logically follows the sequence of being at a location, verifying resource availability, and updating the status once the resource is collected.\n\nThis merged action is flexible enough to be used for various scavenging scenarios while maintaining clarity and efficiency."

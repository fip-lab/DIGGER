The effects update the state to reflect that the resource has been collected.\n3. **Simplicity:** The redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects and using abstract parameters.\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\n### Problem Definition for \"drink_water_task\"\n\n```lisp\n(define (problem drink_water_task)\n  (:domain drink_water)\n  (:objects\n    hole1 - location\n    container1 container2 - container\n    plastic_sheet1 - plastic_sheet\n    stone1 - object\n    leaves1 - object\n    water_source1 - water_source\n    fire_source1 - fire_source\n    fabric1 - fabric\n    location1 - location\n  )\n  (:init\n    (at hole1)\n    (empty container1)\n    (empty container2)\n    (available plastic_sheet1)\n    (available stone1)\n    (available leaves1)\n    (running_stream water_source1)\n    (available fire_source1)\n    (available fabric1)\n    (rain)\n    (natural_container container2)\n    (plastic_sheet_set plastic_sheet1)\n  )\n  (:goal\n    (and\n      (collected container1)\n      (collected container2)\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Summary:\nThe merged action `collect_resource` is designed to be flexible and applicable to various resource collection tasks, ensuring simplicity and efficiency while maintaining logical consistency. The problem definition demonstrates how this action can be used in the context of the \"drink_water_task\" scenario, achieving the goal of collecting water in different containers.",
    "Based on your requirements and the provided examples, I've merged the actions to create a universal \"boil\" action. This merged action is designed to capture the essence of boiling water by combining the preconditions and effects from the given actions, while ensuring generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action boil ; Boil water using available resources\n    :parameters (?resource - resource ?source - source ?container - container ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?resource ?source)\n                    (available ?tool)\n                    (empty ?container))\n    :effect (and\n              (boiled_water ?container)\n              (not (empty ?container))\n              (not (available ?tool)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?resource`, `?source`, `?container`, `?tool`) to adapt to various contexts.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the state (boiling water and updating the availability of tools).\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and ensuring a clear and concise description.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action captures the core logic of boiling water using available resources, effectively combining the actions while adhering to the provided guidelines.",
    "```lisp\n(:action navigate ; Navigate to a resource and update status\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (not (at_resource ?entity ?resource))\n                    (known_resource ?entity ?resource)\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (at_resource ?entity ?resource)\n              (status_updated ?entity ?resource)\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action `navigate` uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?resource` to represent various entities and resources, making it adaptable to multiple tasks.\n   \n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions require that the entity is not currently at the resource and that the resource is known to the entity.\n   - The effects update the state to indicate that the entity is now at the resource and its status has been updated.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action combines the essential logic from both `navigate_to_landmark` and `purify_water` without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable in different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged `navigate` action can be used to represent a variety of tasks where an entity needs to navigate to a resource and update its status accordingly.",
    "To create a universal action that combines the given actions for purifying water and crafting a spear, we can create an abstract action named `purify`. This action will generalize the concept of transforming an entity's state from an impure or uncrafted state to a purified or crafted state. Below is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action purify ; Transform an entity's state from impure/uncrafted to pure/crafted\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?resource1 - object ?resource2 - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (resource1_available ?resource1)\n                    (resource2_available ?resource2)\n                    (not (entity_purified ?entity))\n                  )\n    :effect (entity_purified ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?entity`, `?resource1`, and `?resource2` to adapt to various tasks.\n   - This makes the action applicable to different scenarios, such as purifying water or crafting a spear.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions include the availability of `resource1` and `resource2`, and the entity is not yet purified or crafted.\n   - The effect indicates that the entity is now purified or crafted.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - The core logic of preconditions (resources being available and entity not yet purified/crafted) and the effect (entity being purified/crafted) is retained.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The action merges the similar effects of purifying water and crafting a spear, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable across different tasks, maintaining logical consistency.\n\nBy using this merged action, we can adapt the same structure to various tasks that involve transforming an entity's state with the help of two resources.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action called \"cover,\" we need to ensure that it adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's how the \"cover\" action can be structured:\n\n```pddl\n(:action cover\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (suitable_cover ?entity)\n                    (prepared ?target)\n                    (not (covered ?target))\n                  )\n    :effect (covered ?target)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality:** The parameters `?entity` and `?target` are kept abstract as `- object` to apply to a variety of covering tasks, whether it's covering a shelter, a book, or other objects.\n  \n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly outline the transformation. The action checks if the `?entity` is suitable for covering (`suitable_cover ?entity`), and if the `?target` is ready to be covered (`prepared ?target`). If these conditions are met and the target is not already covered, the effect marks the target as covered.\n\n- **Simplicity:** The redundancy is avoided by abstracting the parameters and combining similar logical constructs, which simplifies the action while retaining its core functionality.\n\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistency across different contexts by using general conditions like `suitable_cover` and `prepared`, ensuring the logic is reasonable and adaptable to different tasks.\n\nThis merged \"cover\" action can be applied to any scenario where an entity is used to cover a target, provided the target is prepared and the covering entity is suitable, reflecting a generic yet effective approach.",
    "Certainly! Let's merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action named `craft`, following the guidelines you've provided:\n\n### Merged Action: `craft`\n\n```lisp\n(:action craft ; Craft a new item or collect resources and update the status\n    :parameters (?entity1 - object ?entity2 - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (found ?entity1)\n                    (found ?entity2)\n                    (not (crafted ?entity1 ?entity2))\n                  )\n    :effect (crafted ?entity1 ?entity2)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action `craft` uses abstract parameters `?entity1` and `?entity2` to remain applicable to various crafting tasks. This design allows it to be used for crafting different items (like a spear) or collecting resources (like condensation).\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The preconditions `(found ?entity1)` and `(found ?entity2)` indicate that the necessary entities or resources must be available or acquired before crafting can take place.\n   - The effect `(crafted ?entity1 ?entity2)` signifies that the crafting or collection process has been completed and the state of the involved entities is updated.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - By abstracting the specific items into generic placeholders (`?entity1` and `?entity2`), redundancy is minimized, and the action remains simple yet powerful enough to handle various situations.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The logic of requiring two found entities before crafting ensures that the action is consistently applicable across different contexts. The effect consistently reflects the successful completion of crafting or collecting.\n\nThis merged action should efficiently handle a variety of crafting or resource collection tasks, adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency."

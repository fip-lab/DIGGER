    "When merging the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action named `gather`, we need to ensure that the action is general, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here's how you can combine the provided actions into one universal action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action gather ; Gather resources and update their status\n    :parameters (?x - resource)\n    :precondition (and (available ?x) (not (gathered ?x)))\n    :effect (gathered ?x)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses an abstract parameter `?x - resource`, which can represent any type of resource, such as tinder, kindling, twigs, or branches. This allows the action to adapt to various tasks involving gathering different resources.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are clear and concise. The action checks if the resource is available and not yet gathered, and the effect is to mark the resource as gathered.\n   \n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - By using a single parameter `?x` and abstracting the resource type, the action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logic is consistently applied across different contexts: checking availability and marking as gathered, ensuring the action can be used in any task involving gathering resources.\n\nThe merged action provides a streamlined and efficient way to handle a variety of gathering tasks without losing the essential logic of the original actions.",
    "Here's the merged PDDL action for the \"prepare\" tasks, following the guidelines to create a universal action that is adaptable, clear in state changes, simple, and logically consistent:\n\n```lisp\n(:action prepare\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?resource1 - object ?resource2 - object ?status - status)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (or (collected ?resource1) (available ?resource1))\n                  (or (collected ?resource2) (available ?resource2))\n                  (not (?status ?entity))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n            (?status ?entity)\n            (not (available ?resource1))\n            (not (available ?resource2))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?resource1`, `?resource2`, `?status`) to make it adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the necessary resources are either collected or available, and the entity's status is not yet updated. The effects update the entity's status and mark the resources as used.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action merges the core logic of all provided actions, avoiding redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different tasks, clearly reflecting the state changes.\n\nBy using this merged action, various tasks like creating a campfire, preparing a snare, preparing a fire pit, or igniting a fire can be modeled by appropriately binding the parameters to specific resources and statuses.",
    "To combine the given actions into a single universal action named `collect`, we need to ensure it captures the essence of all the individual actions while remaining general, simple, and logically consistent. Here's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action collect ; Collect a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?collector - agent ?item - collectable ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (not (collected ?item))\n                  (or (fresh ?item) (dry ?item))\n                  (or (not (volume_full ?container)) (and (exists (?t - tin) (volume_full ?t))))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (collected ?item)\n            (when (volume_full ?container) (volume_empty ?container))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `?collector` represents the agent performing the collection.\n  - `?item` represents the collectable item.\n  - `?container` represents the container involved in the collection process (if applicable).\n\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - The item is not already collected (`(not (collected ?item))`).\n  - The item must either be fresh or dry (`(or (fresh ?item) (dry ?item))`), encompassing the conditions for collecting water, grass tinder, and tinder material.\n  - The container must either not be full or, if it is full, it must be a tin (`(or (not (volume_full ?container)) (and (exists (?t - tin) (volume_full ?t))))`). This covers the scenario where the tin is full before collecting grass tinder.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - The item is marked as collected (`(collected ?item)`).\n  - If the container is full, it becomes empty after the collection (`(when (volume_full ?container) (volume_empty ?container))`). This addresses the effect of the tin becoming empty after collecting grass tinder.\n\n### Applicability:\n\nThis merged action `collect` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks involving the collection of different resources. It ensures that the preconditions and effects are broad enough to cover different scenarios, such as collecting water, grass tinder, and tinder material, while maintaining logical consistency and avoiding redundancy.",
    "The examples provided indicate that the merged actions should be general, adaptable, and avoid redundancy while ensuring logical consistency. Here\u2019s a combined and merged action for the \"boil\" task:\n\n### Merged Action\n```pddl\n(:action boil\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?resource - object ?tool - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (collected ?resource)\n                    (prepared ?tool)\n                    (not (processed ?entity))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (processed ?entity)\n              (state ?entity transformed)\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `boil` is designed to be abstract enough to apply to various tasks involving different entities and resources. The use of generic parameters like `?entity`, `?resource`, and `?tool` increases its adaptability.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the resources are collected and the necessary tools are prepared. The effect marks the entity as processed and changes its state to transformed.\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action simplifies the task by combining the necessary steps into one action, avoiding redundancy and ensuring efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied to different contexts while maintaining clear and reasonable conditions.\n\nBy following this approach, the merged action captures the essence of the individual actions, ensuring that the entity's state is progressively transformed until the goal state is reached. This action can be adapted for tasks such as boiling water, cooking food, or any other process that involves resource collection, preparation, and state transformation.",
    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"set\", we need to ensure that the action is general, captures relevant state changes, maintains simplicity, and remains logically consistent. Here's how we can achieve this:\n\n### Merged Action: `set`\n\n```pddl\n(:action set ; Set a tool or resource and modify its state\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?resource - object)\n    :precondition (and (ready ?resource) (visible ?agent))\n    :effect (and (set ?resource) (invisible ?agent))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - **Parameters:** The action uses abstract parameters `?agent` and `?resource` to increase applicability across various contexts. `?agent` represents any entity capable of interacting with the environment (e.g., NPC, player, etc.), and `?resource` represents any object or tool that can be manipulated (e.g., snare, tinder, etc.).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the `?resource` is ready, and the `?agent` is visible, reflecting a state where an action is feasible.\n   - The effects capture the setting of the `?resource` and the change in visibility of the `?agent`, clearly illustrating the transformation in the environment.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - By merging similar actions, we avoid redundancy. The action focuses on the essential logic needed to set a tool or resource, without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable across different scenarios involving setting a resource or tool.\n\nThis merged action is designed to encapsulate a broad range of tasks that involve setting up resources or tools, such as snares or tinder, and is adaptable to multiple scenarios due to its abstract parameters and straightforward logic.",
    "(:action avoid ; Avoid a potentially hazardous entity\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?hazard - entity)\n  :precondition (and (hazardous ?hazard) (not (encountered ?agent ?hazard)))\n  :effect (safe_from ?agent ?hazard)\n)\n\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters are kept abstract (`?agent` and `?hazard`) to apply to various entities and situations, making the action adaptable to multiple tasks involving avoidance.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions check if the hazard is potentially dangerous (`hazardous ?hazard`) and that the agent has not yet encountered it (`not (encountered ?agent ?hazard)`). The effect ensures that the agent is now safe from the hazard (`safe_from ?agent ?hazard`).\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action is simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by combining the logic of avoiding hazardous entities into a single action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistency by clearly defining when an entity should avoid another and the resulting state change, ensuring the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action should accomplish the goal of avoiding various hazardous entities in a consistent and adaptable manner."

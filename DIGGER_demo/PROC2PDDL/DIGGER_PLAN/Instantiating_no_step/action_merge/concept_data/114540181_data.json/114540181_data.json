    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action, we must consider the commonalities and abstract the parameters to ensure generality, while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity. Based on the given examples, here's how we can merge the \"forage\" related actions:\n\n### Merged Action: Forage\n\n```pddl\n(:action forage ; Forage a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?resource - entity ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (at_location ?resource ?location)\n                    (known_resource ?resource)\n                    (accessible ?location))\n    :effect (and \n              (collected ?resource)\n              (not (at_location ?resource ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The parameters are generalized to `?resource - entity` and `?location - location`, making it applicable to various resources and locations.\n   \n2. **State Change:**\n   - The action reflects a change in state from not collected to collected, and the resource is no longer at the location, which is a common state change in foraging or gathering scenarios.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - By removing specifics like `in_jungle` and focusing on `accessible`, the action is made simpler and applicable to a broader range of scenarios.\n   \n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the resource is known and accessible, maintaining logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of foraging tasks and can be adapted to various scenarios that involve collecting or gathering resources in a location-based manner.",
    "(:action build\n    :parameters (?builder - agent ?tool - object ?location - location ?material1 - object ?material2 - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?builder)\n                    (in_sunlight ?location)\n                    (has ?builder ?tool)\n                    (has ?builder ?material1)\n                    (has ?builder ?material2))\n    :effect (and\n              (built ?builder ?location)\n              (created ?location ?material1 ?material2 ?tool))\n)\n\n### Explanation\n\n**Generality**: The merged action `build` uses abstract parameters such as `?builder`, `?tool`, `?location`, `?material1`, and `?material2` to apply to a variety of tasks. This ensures that the action is not limited to specific types of building actions.\n\n**State Change**: The preconditions and effects of the action reflect the change in state. The action requires that the builder is available and has the necessary materials and tools. The effect is that something is built at the location using the provided materials and tool.\n\n**Simplicity**: Redundant elements from the original actions have been removed to avoid unnecessary complexity. The merged action is straightforward and efficient.\n\n**Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, with clear preconditions and effects for building something at a specified location using specified materials and tools. This ensures that the action is applicable in various contexts where building is required.\n\nThis merged action `build` can now be used in different scenarios, such as constructing a solar still, creating a shelter, or any other task that involves building with specific materials and tools.",
    "The goal is to merge actions into a single, universal PDDL action that maintains generality, state change clarity, core logic, and simplicity. Based on the provided example of merging \"check\" actions, let's apply the same principles to merge the \"filter\" actions.\n\nGiven Action:\n- **filter_particles**: Filters particles from water using fabric.\n\n### Merged Action: `filter`\n\nThe merged action should be generalized to apply to various filtering tasks involving different resources and objects.\n\n```pddl\n(:action filter\n    ; Abstract action to filter a resource using a specified method\n    :parameters (?resource - entity ?method - tool)\n    :precondition (and (contaminated ?resource) (type ?method filter))\n    :effect (and (not (contaminated ?resource)) (filtered ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters `?resource` and `?method` are abstract, allowing the action to apply to various filtering tasks, not just water and fabric.\n- **State Change**: The precondition `(contaminated ?resource)` implies the resource needs filtering, while the effect `(not (contaminated ?resource))` and `(filtered ?resource)` show the resource's state change to being filtered.\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic is retained by requiring a contaminated resource and a filtering method with the correct type.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is simple and efficient, focusing only on necessary state changes without additional complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring logical consistency across different tasks.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"start,\" adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can abstract the parameters and commonalities in the preconditions and effects. Here's the merged action:\n\nAction name after merge: start\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n```\n(:action start_fire\n    :parameters (?f - fire ?w - water)\n    :precondition (and (not (lit ?f)) (filtered ?w))\n    :effect (and (lit ?f) (boiling ?w))\n)\n```\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n```\n(:action start ; Initialize or activate a process or entity\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and (not (activated ?entity)) (prepared ?resource))\n    :effect (and (activated ?entity) (utilized ?resource))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The parameters are abstracted to `?entity` and `?resource` to make the action applicable to various tasks, not limited to starting a fire.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes. `not (activated ?entity)` and `prepared ?resource` indicate the initial state, while `activated ?entity` and `utilized ?resource` show the resulting state.\n- **Simplicity:** The action is kept simple by removing unnecessary complexities and combining similar effects.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied in different contexts while maintaining clear and reasonable logic.",
    "To merge the given action into a universal \"collect\" action that maintains generality and adaptability across various tasks, the following structure can be applied. This merged action will include abstract parameters that can apply to different scenarios involving collection, while ensuring efficiency and logical consistency.\n\n### Merged Action: Collect\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect\n    ; Collect resources and update their status\n    :parameters (?collector - agent ?source - resource ?destination - location)\n    :precondition (and (available ?collector) (resource_available ?source))\n    :effect (and (resource_collected ?destination) (not (resource_available ?source)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters (`?collector`, `?source`, `?destination`) to ensure it can be applied to various collecting tasks. The `?collector` is an agent performing the collection, `?source` is the resource to be collected, and `?destination` is where the resource is moved to.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions: The `?collector` must be available and the `?source` must be a resource available for collection. This is akin to the original context where the rainfall must be available to be collected.\n   - Effects: The resource is marked as collected at the `?destination`, and it is no longer available at the `?source`, reflecting the state change from available to collected.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar effects into a single effect that marks the resource as collected and no longer available.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects that can be consistently applied to different collection tasks, such as collecting rainfall, materials, or any other resources.\n\nThis universal action can be adapted to collect various resources, ensuring flexibility and applicability across different planning domains and tasks.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"bend,\" we need to ensure that the new action is general enough to apply to a variety of tasks, captures the state changes effectively, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action bend ; Perform a state-changing action on a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?resource - object ?additional - object)\n  :precondition (and (resource_collected ?entity) (ready ?additional))\n  :effect (and (resource_processed ?resource) (not (resource_collected ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The action parameters are defined abstractly (?entity, ?resource, ?additional) to apply to various tasks involving different entities and resources.\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions involve a collected resource and a ready additional element (like a container or fire). The effects reflect the processed status of the resource and the removal of the collected state from the entity.\n3. **Core Logic:** The core logic of checking the preconditions and applying the effects is retained without unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:** The merged action combines similar effects of the original actions, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n5. **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects are logical and consistent, ensuring the action can adapt to different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted for various tasks by specifying the appropriate parameters for entities, resources, and additional elements involved in the task."

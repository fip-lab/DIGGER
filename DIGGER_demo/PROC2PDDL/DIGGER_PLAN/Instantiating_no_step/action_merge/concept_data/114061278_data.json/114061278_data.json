    "To create a merged \"drain\" action that captures the essence of the provided actions, we need to ensure that it maintains generality, effectively describes state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here is a proposed merged action:\n\n```PDDL\n(:action drain\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?container - object ?tool - object ?person - agent)\n    :precondition (and\n        (or (coconut ?entity) (other_container ?entity))\n        (contains_liquid ?entity)\n        (empty ?container)\n        (in_hand ?tool ?person)\n        (or (hole_bored ?entity) (not (hole_bored ?entity)))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (not (contains_liquid ?entity))\n        (contains_liquid ?container)\n        (or (coconut_location ?entity in_glass)\n            (coconut_location ?entity in_container))\n        (or (coconut_condition ?entity drained)\n            (coconut_condition ?entity not_drained))\n        (or (not (screwdriver_positioned ?tool ?entity))\n            (screwdriver_positioned ?tool ?entity))\n        (or (hole_widened ?entity) (not (hole_widened ?entity)))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action is generalized to apply to any `object` that contains liquid and any `object` that can serve as a container. It uses abstract parameters like `?entity`, `?container`, `?tool`, and `?person` to increase applicability across different contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions include checking if the entity contains liquid and the container is empty. The effects describe the transfer of liquid from the entity to the container and account for changes in the entity's condition and location.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The action maintains the core logic of the original actions by considering conditions like whether a hole is bored, and whether a tool is positioned, while remaining flexible for different contexts.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By using logical OR conditions, the action accounts for various states (e.g., whether a hole is bored or not), eliminating the need for separate actions for each state.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are structured to ensure that they remain logically consistent regardless of the specific task, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different scenarios.\n\nThis merged action should be flexible enough to handle a variety of tasks involving draining or transferring liquid, while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.",
    "Given the merged action guidelines and the provided actions, the merged \"poke\" action should be designed to generalize the process of poking a hole in a coconut using a set of tools. Here\u2019s the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action poke\n  :parameters (?c - coconut ?s - tool ?m - tool)\n  :precondition (and \n                 (coconut_condition ?c intact)\n                 (tool_location ?s in_hand)\n                 (tool_location ?m in_hand)\n                )\n  :effect (and \n           (coconut_condition ?c hole_poked)\n           (not (coconut_condition ?c intact))\n           (tool_used ?s)\n           (tool_used ?m)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to `?c - coconut`, `?s - tool`, and `?m - tool` to apply to various tools.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects describe the state transformation from an intact coconut to a coconut with a hole.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects and keeping the preconditions concise.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic ensures that the tools are in hand and the coconut is intact before the action, and after the action, the coconut has a hole and is no longer intact.\n\nThis merged action captures the core logic of the given actions while maintaining simplicity and adaptability.",
    "(:action break\n  :parameters (?coconut - coconut ?tool - object ?surface - surface ?towel - cloth)\n  :precondition (and \n                (or (hole_in_eye ?coconut) (cooled ?coconut))\n                (or (wrapped ?coconut ?towel) (at ?coconut ?surface))\n                (or (in_hand ?tool) (at ?tool ?surface))\n                (not (broken ?coconut)))\n  :effect (and \n          (broken ?coconut)\n          (not (wrapped ?coconut ?towel))\n          (not (at ?coconut ?surface)))\n)\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `break` can be used in multiple contexts for breaking a coconut. It uses abstract parameters `?tool` and `?surface` to provide flexibility in the breaking method (either using a hammer or a concrete surface).\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes, like ensuring the coconut is either cooled or has a hole in the eye, is either wrapped or at a surface, and is not already broken. The effect ensures the coconut is broken, and if it was wrapped, it is unwrapped.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining multiple similar preconditions and effects into a single action with logical ORs.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring the necessary preconditions are met for different contexts (using a hammer or a surface) and updating the state accordingly.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the individual actions while increasing its applicability and maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.",
    "To create a merged action that encompasses both \"strike_coconut_on_surface\" and \"bore-hole\" actions, we need to abstract the parameters and generalize the preconditions and effects while ensuring logical consistency and simplicity.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```\n(:action strike\n    ; Strike an item using a tool or against a surface to modify its state\n    :parameters (?p - person ?i - item ?t - tool ?s - surface)\n    :precondition (and \n                   (in_hand ?t ?p)\n                   (on_surface ?i ?s)\n                   (not (modified ?i))\n                  )\n    :effect (modified ?i)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to be adaptable to various tasks. We use `?p` for person, `?i` for item, `?t` for tool, and `?s` for surface.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes for the item. Preconditions ensure the necessary states before the action is applied, and the effect indicates the modified state.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects from both actions are retained. We ensure that the person has the tool in hand and that the item is on the surface before striking. The `modified` effect is a generalized term that can apply to both breaking a coconut or boring a hole.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By using generic parameters and combining the logic of striking with a tool or on a surface, we avoid redundancy and simplify the actions.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic applicable in different contexts, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"strike\" is adaptable to a variety of tasks involving striking an item to modify its state, providing a simple, efficient, and logically consistent approach.",
    "Given the guidelines and examples provided, the merged action for the \"wrap\" task should be able to generalize across different wrapping situations and maintain logical consistency while avoiding redundancy. Here\u2019s the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action\n```lisp\n(:action wrap\n  ; Wrap an item with another item to change its state\n  :parameters (?wrapper - object ?wrappee - object)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (in_hand ?wrapper) \n                  (appropriate_state ?wrappee)\n                  (not (wrapped ?wrappee ?wrapper))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (wrapped ?wrappee ?wrapper) \n            (not (appropriate_state ?wrappee))\n            (new_state ?wrappee))\n)\n```\n\n### Breakdown and Reasoning:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Parameters**: The parameters are kept abstract (`?wrapper` and `?wrappee` as objects) to apply to a variety of wrapping tasks, involving different items.\n   - **Preconditions**: General preconditions like `in_hand ?wrapper` and `appropriate_state ?wrappee`, where `appropriate_state` can be any condition that needs to be met before wrapping.\n   - **Effects**: The effects ensure that the item is now wrapped (`wrapped ?wrappee ?wrapper`), the previous state is negated, and a new state is established.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. For example, `appropriate_state ?wrappee` can represent states like `hot` for a coconut or `clean` for a towel, and `new_state ?wrappee` represents the new state after being wrapped.\n   \n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar effects and using abstract parameters. This ensures the action is both simple and efficient.\n   \n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are kept consistent and logical across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\n### Example Instantiation:\nTo illustrate how this merged action can be instantiated for specific tasks, consider the following examples:\n\n#### Example 1: Wrapping a Coconut in a Towel\n```lisp\n(:action wrap\n  :parameters (?t - towel ?c - coconut)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (in_hand ?t) \n                  (coconut_location ?c in_oven)\n                  (coconut_condition ?c hole_poked)\n                  (coconut_temperature ?c hot)\n                  (not (wrapped ?c ?t))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (wrapped ?c ?t) \n            (not (coconut_location ?c in_oven))\n            (coconut_temperature ?c cooled))\n)\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Wrapping a Gift with Wrapping Paper\n```lisp\n(:action wrap\n  :parameters (?wp - wrapping_paper ?g - gift)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (in_hand ?wp) \n                  (gift_unwrapped ?g)\n                  (not (wrapped ?g ?wp))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (wrapped ?g ?wp) \n            (not (gift_unwrapped ?g))\n            (gift_wrapped ?g))\n)\n```\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the merged action `wrap` can be adapted to different contexts, maintaining abstract parameters and consistent logic while clearly changing the state of the entities involved.",

    "Certainly! Let's merge the provided actions into a single universal action that can apply to a variety of search-related tasks. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: `search`\n\n```lisp\n(:action search ; Search a location and update the search status\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?agent ?location)\n    (not (found ?agent ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (found ?agent ?item)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name:** `search` - This action represents a generic search task that can be adapted to various contexts.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `?agent` (the person performing the search)\n  - `?item` (the object being searched for)\n  - `?location` (the place where the search is conducted)\n- **Preconditions:** The agent must be at the specified location, and the item must not yet have been found by the agent.\n- **Effects:** The item will be marked as found by the agent.\n\n### Example Applications:\n1. **Searching for a Water Source:**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action search_for_water_source\n     :parameters (?agent - person ?location - place)\n     :precondition (and\n       (at ?agent ?location)\n       (not (found ?agent water_source))\n     )\n     :effect (found ?agent water_source)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Searching an Area:**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action search_area\n     :parameters (?agent - person ?location - place ?area - area)\n     :precondition (and\n       (at ?agent ?location)\n       (not (found ?agent ?area))\n     )\n     :effect (found ?agent ?area)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Benefits:\n- **Generality:** The merged action `search` is designed to be adaptable to different tasks involving searching for various items or entities in different locations.\n- **State Change:** Clearly describes the state change by marking the item as found once the search is completed.\n- **Simplicity:** Avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into a single, efficient action.\n- **Logical Consistency:** Maintains consistent logic for preconditions and effects across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\nThis merged action can be easily adapted to specific tasks by defining the appropriate parameters, preconditions, and effects for each unique context.",
    "To merge the given actions into a universal action named \"find,\" we need to create an abstract action that generalizes the task of finding any collectible item. This involves using abstract parameters and ensuring the preconditions and effects reflect the state change consistently across different tasks.\n\n### Original Actions to be Merged:\n\n1. **Find Tinder**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action find_tinder\n       :parameters (?t - tinder)\n       :precondition (not (collected ?t))\n       :effect (collected ?t)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Gather Kindling**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action gather_kindling\n       :parameters (?k - kindling)\n       :precondition (not (collected ?k))\n       :effect (collected ?k)\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Area** (not explicitly given, but assumed structure)\n   ```pddl\n   (:action search_for_area\n       :parameters (?a - area)\n       :precondition (not (searched ?a))\n       :effect (searched ?a)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action find ; Universal action for finding and collecting items\n    :parameters (?entity - collectible)\n    :precondition (not (collected ?entity))\n    :effect (collected ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses an abstract parameter `?entity - collectible` to represent any item that can be found and collected, rather than specifying `tinder`, `kindling`, or `area`. This abstraction allows the action to be applied to any collectible entity.\n  \n- **State Change**: The precondition `(not (collected ?entity))` ensures that the item has not been collected yet, and the effect `(collected ?entity)` indicates the change in state after the action is performed.\n\n- **Simplicity**: Redundant details specific to each original action are removed, focusing on the core logic of finding and collecting an item.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent with the logic of finding and collecting items, applying the same reasoning to different contexts.\n\nThis merged action \"find\" can be used for any task that involves searching for and collecting a collectible item, maintaining simplicity and efficiency.",
    "Given the provided actions and the need to merge them into a single universal action that adheres to the guidelines, here's a merged PDDL action for the \"start\" task:\n\n### Merged Action: start\n\n```pddl\n(:action start\n    :parameters (?actor - person ?resource - object ?location - area)\n    :precondition (and (available ?actor) \n                       (collected ?resource) \n                       (selected ?location)\n                       (not (started ?actor ?resource ?location)))\n    :effect (and (started ?actor ?resource ?location)\n                 (fire_started ?location))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - `?actor` - Represents the person who is performing the action.\n   - `?resource` - Represents the generic resource being used, which can be tinder or kindling.\n   - `?location` - Represents the area where the action is taking place.\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - The `?actor` must be available (`available ?actor`).\n   - The `?resource` must be collected (`collected ?resource`).\n   - The `?location` must be selected (`selected ?location`).\n   - The action must not have been started before (`not (started ?actor ?resource ?location)`).\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - The action marks the start of the process (`started ?actor ?resource ?location`).\n   - The fire is started in the specified location (`fire_started ?location`).\n\n### Merged Action Logic:\n\n- **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?actor`, `?resource`, and `?location` to allow for flexibility in different tasks.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that all necessary resources and conditions are met before starting the action, and the effects indicate the successful start of the action and the desired outcome (fire started).\n- **Simplicity**: The action combines the necessary steps with minimal complexity, avoiding redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are maintained consistently across different contexts, ensuring clear logic.\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the logic required to start a process, applying to various tasks that involve checking resources and initiating actions in a specific location."

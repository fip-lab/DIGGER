Preconditions ensure the casing is removed, and the glass is empty. The effect is the coconut being drained and the glass being filled.\n- **break-coconut**: This action breaks the coconut using a hammer while it is still wrapped.

Position your young coconut on a cutting board, and use a sharp cleaver or a sturdy chef\u2019s knife to slice off the outer casing. Carve at an angle, as if you were removing the skin from an apple, until you expose the hard inner shell. Work to expose as much of the shell as possible.\n2. **Drain Coconut Water**: Turn the coconut upside down over a glass and allow it to drain. Let the coconut sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get the last bit of water out of it.\n3. **Wrap Coconut in Towel**: Wrap the mature coconut in a kitchen towel. Place the coconut in the center of the towel, and gather the corners of the towel together to form a pouch. This will keep coconut bits from flying when you go to smash it with a hammer.\n4. **Whack Coconut with Hammer**: Whack the wrapped coconut with a hammer, or bash it against a hard surface. With the coconut still wrapped in the towel, use a hammer or a mallet to repeatedly and forcefully whack the coconut. Turn the coconut as you hammer it, in order to strike it from multiple angles. Hammer it until you feel it break open beneath the towel.\n5. **Cool Coconut**: Remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel to cool. Use oven mitts to retrieve the coconut from the oven or microwave, and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes while wrapped in a towel. Doing this ensures you don\u2019t have hot coconut bits flying everywhere when you go to smash it in the next step.\n6. **Separate Meat from Shell**: Use a knife to separate the meat from the shell. Remove the coconut pieces from the towel. Take each piece, and wedge a knife between the shell and the white meat of the coconut to carefully separate the two. Then, use the knife (or a vegetable peeler) or remove the fibrous layer that might still be clinging to the outside of the meat.\n\nThese actions follow the provided steps and descriptions, ensuring that each action's preconditions and effects align with the expected entity states before and after each step.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

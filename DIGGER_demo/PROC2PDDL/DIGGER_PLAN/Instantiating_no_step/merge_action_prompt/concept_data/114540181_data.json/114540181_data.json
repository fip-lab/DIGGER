The preconditions ensure the location is in the jungle and that the plant is recognized as edible. The effect is that the plant is collected and is no longer at the location.\n\n- **Build Solar Water Still**: This action involves constructing a solar water still with a container and a plastic sheet in an area that receives sunlight. The preconditions check that the location is sunny and that the necessary materials are available. The effect is that the solar still is built, and water is collected in the container.\n\nThese actions align with the task of addressing hunger by finding food and creating a means to obtain water. If there were additional steps or relevant tasks, more actions could be added accordingly.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:insert\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action insert_branch_into_tree_split\n    :parameters (?b - branch ?t - tree)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (found_branch ?b)\n                    (tree_has_split ?t)\n                    (not (branch_inserted ?b ?t))\n                  )\n    :effect (branch_inserted ?b ?t)\n)\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Dig a deep hole for water collection.\nThis step seems more related to survival rather than building a shelter. However, if we consider it as part of the shelter-building process (perhaps as a water source near the shelter), we can include it.\n\n```lisp\n\n(:action place_branch_in_other_tree\n    :parameters (?b - branch ?t1 - tree ?t2 - tree)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (branch_inserted ?b ?t1)\n                    (tree_has_split ?t2)\n                    (not (horizontal_frame_formed ?b ?t1 ?t2))\n                  )\n    :effect (horizontal_frame_formed ?b ?t1 ?t2)\n)\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- **Conditions and Effects**: The preconditions and effects are designed to reflect the logical sequence of actions (e.g., a branch must be found before it can be inserted).\n- **Entities and Parameters**: Parameters such as `?b - branch` and `?t - tree` are used to represent the objects involved in the actions.\n- **Irrelevant Steps**: Step 2 was adjusted to fit the context of building a shelter by considering it as a water source setup near the shelter.\n\nThese actions capture the sequence and logic needed to build a basic shelter using branches and trees, as described in the task.\n(:action set_snare\n    :parameters (?p - person ?s - snare ?l - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (assembled ?s)\n                    (strategic_location ?l)\n                    (not (set ?s))\n                  )\n    :effect (set ?s)\n)\n```\nExplanation:\n1. **look_for_mushrooms**: This action involves a person looking for mushrooms in a dark and damp location. The precondition checks if the person is trained and the location is suitable. The effect is that the mushroom is collected.\n2. **collect_materials**: This action involves a person collecting necessary materials. The precondition checks if the material is available and not yet collected. The effect is that the material is collected.\n3. **assemble_snare**: This action involves assembling the snare. The precondition checks if the snare materials are collected and not yet assembled. The effect is that the snare is assembled.\n4. **set_snare**: This action involves setting the snare in a strategic location. The precondition checks if the snare is assembled and the location is strategic. The effect is that the snare is set.\n\nThese actions follow the structure and format provided in the example and are tailored to the task of building a snare.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

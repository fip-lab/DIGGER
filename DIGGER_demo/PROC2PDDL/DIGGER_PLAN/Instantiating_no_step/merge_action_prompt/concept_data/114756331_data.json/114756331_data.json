Preconditions require the ground to be unobserved, and the effect is that the ground becomes observed and quicksand is identified.\n- **mark-quicksand:** Marks the identified quicksand location using a marker. Preconditions require quicksand to be identified and a marker to be available. The effect is that the location is marked, and the marker is no longer available.\n- **plan-alternative-path:** Plans a new route to avoid the marked quicksand area. Preconditions require the current path to be blocked by quicksand and the area to be marked. The effect is that an alternative path is planned, and the original path is no longer blocked.\n- **navigate-around-quicksand:** Safely navigates the planned path around the quicksand. Preconditions require an alternative path to be planned, and the effect is that the path is safely navigated.\n\nThis hypothetical example demonstrates how to translate task steps and descriptions into PDDL actions with appropriate preconditions and effects.

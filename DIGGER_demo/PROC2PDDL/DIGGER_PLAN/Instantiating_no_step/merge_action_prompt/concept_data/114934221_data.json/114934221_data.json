The precondition checks if the weapon is still in the vehicle and if the agent doesn't know where to aim. The effect updates the weapon's location to on the ground and the agent knows where to aim.\n\n- **Hit_Shark**: This action involves hitting the shark. The precondition ensures the shark hasn't retreated and the agent knows where to aim. The effect causes the shark to retreat and stops its attack.\n\n- **Monitor_Shark**: This action involves monitoring the shark's movements. The precondition checks if the agent doesn't know the shark's location, and the effect updates the agent's knowledge of the shark's location.\n\n- **Avoid_Blocking_Shark**: This action involves avoiding blocking the shark's path. The precondition checks if the agent is blocking the shark's path, and the effect is to remove the blockage.\n\nThese actions are derived from the task descriptions and entity states, capturing the necessary steps to achieve the \"ultimate_win\" task.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

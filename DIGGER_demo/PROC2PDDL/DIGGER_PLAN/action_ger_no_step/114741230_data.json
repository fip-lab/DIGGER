    "Sure, let's generate the PDDL actions based on the provided task and descriptions.\n\nTask: remove_players\n\nSteps:\n1. Conduct a proper initiation for you and your closest friend.\n2. Meet in secret.\n3. Create a way to remove someone if they become bad for the group.\n4. Make a dress code.\n5. Initiate well-to-do people in the society.\n6. Think of a name.\n7. Create a secret or a secret mission.\n8. Read a few clique-like books for background information.\n\nDescriptions:\n- Conduct a proper initiation for you and your closest friend. This should be done before you initiate others. That way, you are sure to come up with a good idea. The initiation is one of the most important parts of the society. It has to be something neither of you would do normally. Candle-lighting sets a serious and official tone, which is always good. Secret names are fun to have.\n- An important thing in secret societies is to meet in secret, that means meeting in a new place every time or having access to a secret room somewhere. You could even figure out a time to chat online.\n- There needs to be a way to get rid of someone if they become bad for the group or start talking\u2014like blabbing the society's secret. If they do, pretend like that was never the secret, but immediately create a new secret. Put this in the rules.\n- Make a dress code. Most small secret societies use robes while large ones, like the Freemasons, have complex aprons.\n- Initiate well-to-do people in the society. In a school, initiate the most brilliant and enthusiastic students that seem like clique-material, and they will motivate and inspire others. But you don't want to have too many members. The more members, the less secret it is. Five to ten should be good.\n- Think of a name. You and your closest friend should discuss what your secret society should be called.\n- Create a secret or a secret mission. A secret society must have something to protect.\n- Read a few clique-like books, like the clique series by Lisi Harrison, for some background information, although, maybe not so mean like they were.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Conduct Initiation\n(:action conduct_initiation\n    :parameters (?p1 - person ?p2 - person)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (initiated ?p1))\n                    (not (initiated ?p2)))\n    :effect (and\n              (initiated ?p1)\n              (initiated ?p2))\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Meet in Secret\n(:action meet_in_secret\n    :parameters (?p - person ?l - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (initiated ?p)\n                    (not (meeting_location ?l)))\n    :effect (meeting_location ?l)\n)\n\n;; Action 3: Remove Player\n(:action remove_player\n    :parameters (?p - person)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (member ?p)\n                    (bad_for_group ?p))\n    :effect (not (member ?p))\n)\n\n;; Action 4: Set Dress Code\n(:action set_dress_code\n    :parameters (?c - dress_code)\n    :precondition (not (dress_code_set))\n    :effect (dress_code_set ?c)\n)\n\n;; Action 5: Initiate New Member\n(:action initiate_new_member\n    :parameters (?p - person)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (initiated ?p1)\n                    (initiated ?p2)\n                    (not (member ?p))\n                    (brilliant ?p)\n                    (enthusiastic ?p))\n    :effect (member ?p)\n)\n\n;; Action 6: Think of a Name\n(:action think_of_name\n    :parameters (?p1 - person ?p2 - person ?n - name)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (initiated ?p1)\n                    (initiated ?p2)\n                    (not (society_named)))\n    :effect (society_named ?n)\n)\n\n;; Action 7: Create Secret Mission\n(:action create_secret_mission\n    :parameters (?p1 - person ?p2 - person ?m - mission)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (initiated ?p1)\n                    (initiated ?p2)\n                    (not (mission_created)))\n    :effect (mission_created ?m)\n)\n\n;; Action 8: Read Background Information\n(:action read_background_information\n    :parameters (?p - person ?b - book)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (initiated ?p)\n                    (not (read ?p ?b)))\n    :effect (read ?p ?b)\n)\n```\n\nThese actions represent the steps and descriptions provided, ensuring that the conditions and effects align with the goal of removing players if necessary and maintaining the integrity of the secret society.",

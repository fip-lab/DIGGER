    "To generate PDDL actions for the task \"fill_the_glass,\" let's first identify the relevant steps and descriptions. Based on the given information, we can derive the following actions:\n\n### PDDL Actions\n\n1. **Action: poke-coconut-eye**\n   - **Parameters:** \n     - `?coconut - coconut`\n     - `?screwdriver - tool`\n     - `?mallet - tool`\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - `(at ?coconut kitchen)`\n     - `(at ?screwdriver toolbox)`\n     - `(at ?mallet toolbox)`\n   - **Effects:** \n     - `(has-hole ?coconut)`\n     - `(not (at ?screwdriver toolbox))`\n     - `(not (at ?mallet toolbox))`\n     - `(at ?screwdriver hand)`\n     - `(at ?mallet hand)`\n\n2. **Action: drain-coconut**\n   - **Parameters:** \n     - `?coconut - coconut`\n     - `?glass - container`\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - `(has-hole ?coconut)`\n     - `(at ?coconut kitchen)`\n     - `(at ?glass kitchen)`\n   - **Effects:** \n     - `(not (at ?coconut kitchen))`\n     - `(at ?coconut glass)`\n     - `(contains ?glass coconut-water)`\n     - `(empty ?coconut)`\n\n3. **Action: shake-coconut**\n   - **Parameters:** \n     - `?coconut - coconut`\n     - `?glass - container`\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - `(has-hole ?coconut)`\n     - `(at ?coconut glass)`\n     - `(contains ?glass coconut-water)`\n   - **Effects:** \n     - `(fully-drained ?coconut)`\n     - `(not (contains ?glass coconut-water))`\n     - `(contains ?glass full-coconut-water)`\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **poke-coconut-eye:** This action represents poking a hole in the coconut using a screwdriver and a mallet. The preconditions ensure that the coconut, screwdriver, and mallet are available in the kitchen, and the effect is that the coconut now has a hole.\n\n2. **drain-coconut:** This action involves turning the coconut upside down over a glass to drain the liquid. The preconditions ensure the coconut has a hole and is positioned over a glass. The effect is that the liquid is transferred to the glass.\n\n3. **shake-coconut:** This action involves shaking the coconut to ensure all the water is drained into the glass. The precondition checks that the coconut is already draining into the glass, and the effect ensures the glass contains the full amount of coconut water.\n\nThese actions capture the necessary steps to fill a glass with coconut water, using the provided tools and descriptions.",
    "To generate PDDL actions for the task \"remove_fibre_from_coconut_meat,\" we will break down each step and create actions based on the descriptions and entity states provided. Here are the PDDL actions based on the task and descriptions:\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action drain_coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?g - glass)\n    :precondition (and (filled_with_liquid ?c) (empty ?g))\n    :effect (and (drained ?c) (filled ?g) (not (filled_with_liquid ?c)))\n)\n\n(:action poke_coconut_eye\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?s - screwdriver ?m - mallet)\n    :precondition (and (drained ?c) (in_hand ?s) (in_hand ?m))\n    :effect (and (hole_in_eye ?c) (not (intact ?c)))\n)\n\n(:action break_coconut_with_hammer\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?h - hammer ?t - towel)\n    :precondition (and (hole_in_eye ?c) (wrapped ?c ?t) (in_hand ?h))\n    :effect (and (broken ?c) (not (wrapped ?c ?t)))\n)\n\n(:action strike_coconut_on_surface\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?s - surface)\n    :precondition (and (hole_in_eye ?c) (on_surface ?c ?s) (not (broken ?c)))\n    :effect (and (broken ?c))\n)\n\n(:action cool_coconut\n    :parameters (?c - coconut ?t - towel)\n    :precondition (and (broken ?c) (in_towel ?c ?t))\n    :effect (and (cooled ?c) (not (hot ?c)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **drain_coconut**: This action represents turning the coconut upside down to drain it. Preconditions include the coconut being filled with liquid and the glass being empty. The effect is that the coconut is drained and the glass is filled.\n\n2. **poke_coconut_eye**: This action involves poking a hole in the coconut's \"eye\" using a screwdriver and mallet. The precondition is that the coconut is drained, and the screwdriver and mallet are in hand. The effect is that there is a hole in the coconut's eye.\n\n3. **break_coconut_with_hammer**: This action represents breaking the coconut using a hammer while it is wrapped in a towel. The precondition includes the coconut having a hole in the eye and being wrapped. The effect is that the coconut is broken.\n\n4. **strike_coconut_on_surface**: This action is an alternative to breaking the coconut with a hammer, using a hard surface instead. The precondition is that the coconut has a hole in the eye and is on a surface. The effect is that the coconut is broken.\n\n5. **cool_coconut**: This action involves cooling the coconut wrapped in a towel. The precondition is that the coconut is broken and in a towel. The effect is that the coconut is cooled.\n\nThese actions collectively describe the process of preparing the coconut for removing the fiber from its meat, based on the steps and descriptions provided.",
    "Certainly! Based on the task \"free_the_meat_from_coconut\" and the provided steps and descriptions, here are the corresponding PDDL actions:\n\n### Task: free_the_meat_from_coconut\n\n### Steps:\n1. Poke a hole in the \u201ceye\u201d of the coconut with a screwdriver and a mallet.\n2. Turn the coconut upside down over a glass and allow it to drain.\n3. Remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel to cool.\n4. Strike the coconut against a concrete surface until it breaks apart.\n\n### Descriptions:\n- Alternatively, strike the coconut against a concrete surface. If you don\u2019t have a hammer or mallet, you can use a solid surface like a porch or possibly a concrete countertop. Try to strike the coconut\u2019s equator against the corner of this surface, using it as a makeshift wedge. Repeatedly strike the coconut all around its equator until the coconut breaks apart.\n- Turn the coconut upside down over a glass and allow it to drain. Let the coconut sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get the last bit of water out of it.\n- Poke a hole in the \u201ceye\u201d of the coconut with a screwdriver and a mallet. Position the pointed end of a screwdriver on one of the 3 holes or \u201ceyes\u201d at the top of the coconut. Then, use a mallet or hammer to carefully but forcefully bore a hole through an eye. Once the screwdriver gives (indicating it\u2019s bored through the shell), remove it by wiggling it out, widening the new hole in the process.\n- Remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel to cool. Use oven mitts to retrieve the coconut from the oven or microwave, and allow it to cool for about 5 minutes while wrapped in a towel. Doing this ensures you don\u2019t have hot coconut bits flying everywhere when you go to smash it in the next step.\n\n### Entity State:\n- coconut\n- screwdriver\n- mallet\n- glass\n- towel\n- concrete_surface\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action poke-hole\n    :parameters (?coconut - coconut ?screwdriver - tool ?mallet - tool)\n    :precondition (and (at ?coconut kitchen) (at ?screwdriver kitchen) (at ?mallet kitchen))\n    :effect (and (hole-in ?coconut) (not (at ?screwdriver kitchen)) (not (at ?mallet kitchen)))\n)\n\n(:action drain-coconut\n    :parameters (?coconut - coconut ?glass - container)\n    :precondition (and (hole-in ?coconut) (at ?coconut kitchen) (at ?glass kitchen))\n    :effect (and (drained ?coconut) (in coconut-water ?glass) (not (at ?coconut kitchen)))\n)\n\n(:action wrap-coconut\n    :parameters (?coconut - coconut ?towel - cloth)\n    :precondition (and (drained ?coconut) (at ?coconut kitchen) (at ?towel kitchen))\n    :effect (and (wrapped ?coconut ?towel) (not (at ?coconut kitchen)) (not (at ?towel kitchen)))\n)\n\n(:action cool-coconut\n    :parameters (?coconut - coconut ?towel - cloth)\n    :precondition (and (wrapped ?coconut ?towel) (at ?coconut kitchen))\n    :effect (and (cooled ?coconut) (not (wrapped ?coconut ?towel)) (at ?towel kitchen))\n)\n\n(:action break-coconut\n    :parameters (?coconut - coconut ?concrete_surface - surface)\n    :precondition (and (cooled ?coconut) (at ?coconut kitchen) (at ?concrete_surface kitchen))\n    :effect (and (broken ?coconut) (not (at ?coconut kitchen)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **poke-hole**: This action describes poking a hole in the coconut using a screwdriver and a mallet.\n2. **drain-coconut**: This action describes turning the coconut upside down over a glass to drain the liquid.\n3. **wrap-coconut**: This action describes wrapping the coconut in a towel.\n4. **cool-coconut**: This action describes allowing the coconut to cool while wrapped in a towel.\n5. **break-coconut**: This action describes striking the coconut against a concrete surface until it breaks apart.",

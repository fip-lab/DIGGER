    "To generate PDDL actions for the task \"find_water,\" we will first interpret the task and descriptions provided. The task involves scavenging for items that could be useful, particularly focusing on finding water. Based on this understanding, I will create PDDL actions that reflect the steps needed to achieve this task, utilizing the entity states and descriptions provided.\n\n### Task: find_water\n\n#### Descriptions:\n- Scavenge anything you can. Before you head to shore, it can be a good idea to gather up any supplies or materials near you. There may be useful items floating on the water's surface that will help you survive and await rescue. Try to look for anything you can use before heading to shore.\n\n#### Entity State:\n- Water is in a boiling pot, initially cold and emptier, but after the action, it is hot and fuller.\n- Water's location changes from \"in pipes\" to \"out of faucet.\"\n- Knowledge suggests water can be found in rivers and is related to rain.\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n#### Action 1: Scavenge_Floating_Items\n```pddl\n(:action scavenge_floating_items\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?location - water_body)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?location)\n                    (floating_items ?location))\n    :effect (and\n              (collected_items ?agent)\n              (not (floating_items ?location))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 2: Find_Water_Source\n```pddl\n(:action find_water_source\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?location - river)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?location)\n                    (river_related_to_water ?location))\n    :effect (and\n              (found_water ?agent)\n              (can_drink ?agent))\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 3: Gather_Water\n```pddl\n(:action gather_water\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?container - boiling_pot ?source - faucet)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?source)\n                    (container_empty ?container)\n                    (water_out_of_faucet ?source))\n    :effect (and\n              (container_full ?container)\n              (water_hot ?container)\n              (not (container_empty ?container)))\n)\n```\n\nThese actions reflect the logical steps required to scavenge for useful items, particularly water, and to gather it using a container. The preconditions and effects are based on the entity states and descriptions provided, ensuring that the actions align with the task's objectives.",

The `@my_decorator` line is a shorthand way of saying `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.\n\nWhen we call `say_hello()`, it's not the original `say_hello` function that gets called, but the `wrapper` function that was returned by `my_decorator`. The `wrapper` function adds some behavior (printing a message) before and after calling the original function.\n\nSo the output of calling `say_hello()` would be:\n\n```\nSomething is happening before the function is called.\nHello!\nSomething is happening after the function is called.\n```\n\nThis is a very simple example, but decorators can be much more complex and powerful. They can modify the arguments passed to the function, change the return value, handle exceptions, and much more. They are a key feature of Python and are used extensively in many Python libraries and frameworks."

Salt (to taste)\n3. Pepper (to taste)\n4. Olive oil (2 tablespoons)\n5. Garlic (2 cloves, minced)\n6. Lemon juice (2 tablespoons)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. First, clean the meat thoroughly under running water. \n\n2. Pat dry the meat using a clean kitchen towel. This is to ensure that the meat will brown nicely when cooked.\n\n3. Season the meat with salt and pepper on all sides. Rub them in to make sure the meat is well seasoned.\n\n4. In a small bowl, combine olive oil, minced garlic, and lemon juice. Stir well.\n\n5. Rub this mixture all over the meat, making sure it's well coated. \n\n6. Let the meat marinate for at least 30 minutes. For best results, marinate it in the refrigerator overnight.\n\n7. Now, the meat is ready to be cooked as per your recipe. \n\nRemember, the key to a delicious meat dish is in the preparation. Always choose fresh, high-quality meat and take the time to prepare it properly. Enjoy your cooking!"

Here's a basic solution but remember, it's illegal to pick locks that aren't yours or without permission from the owner. \n\nMaterials needed:\n1. Tension wrench\n2. Lock pick\n3. Lubricant (optional)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Apply a small amount of lubricant to the lock, this is optional but it can make the process easier by reducing friction.\n\n2. Insert the tension wrench into the bottom of the keyhole. The tension wrench is used to apply pressure to the lock's plug, which is the part that actually unlocks the door when it's turned.\n\n3. Apply slight pressure to the tension wrench, turning it in the direction the lock turns. You should apply just enough pressure to hold the wrench in place, but not so much that it bends.\n\n4. While maintaining pressure on the tension wrench, insert your lock pick into the top of the keyhole.\n\n5. Use the lock pick to probe the pins inside the lock. There are usually five or six pins in a lock, and you'll need to set each one individually.\n\n6. When you find a pin, apply upward pressure to it with the lock pick. If you're applying the correct amount of tension with the wrench, the pin should stay in place once it's been lifted. If it falls back down, you're not applying enough tension.\n\n7. Repeat this process with each pin. You'll need to feel around with the lock pick to find each one, and it may take several tries to set them all.\n\n8. Once all the pins are set, the lock should open when you turn the tension wrench.\n\nRemember, lock picking should only be used for legal purposes, and it can take a lot of practice to get good at it. If you're not able to pick a lock after several tries, it's best to call a professional locksmith."

Here's how to do it:\n\nMaterials needed:\n1. A bag or basket to collect the kindling.\n2. Gloves to protect your hands.\n\nSteps:\n1. Put on your gloves to protect your hands from splinters.\n2. Start your search for kindling. Look for small, dry, easily combustible materials. This could be twigs, small branches, dry grass, pine cones, or even pieces of paper or cardboard. \n3. Test the potential kindling by trying to snap it. If it snaps easily, it's dry and will burn well. If it bends, it's still green and won't burn as well.\n4. Collect a variety of sizes, from very small twigs (which will catch fire quickly) to larger sticks (which will burn longer). \n5. As you gather the kindling, place it in your bag or basket. \n6. Continue gathering until you have enough kindling to start your fire. The exact amount will depend on the size of the fire you want to build, but a good rule of thumb is to gather enough to fill a large shopping bag.\n7. Once you have enough, transport your kindling back to your campfire site or fireplace. Store it in a dry place until you're ready to use it.\n\nRemember: Never strip bark or branches from living trees for kindling, as this can harm the tree. Always look for fallen branches or twigs on the ground."

This method changes the character's position and prints a message. We also create a `Bunker` class that simply holds a position.\n\nThe `move_to_bunker` function takes a character and a bunker as arguments.

        "nl_step": "In order to complete the task \"heal-old-man\", we will need to identify the type of healing the old man needs. This could involve physical, emotional, or mental healing. Here is a possible solution:\n\n1. Identify the Problem: First, we need to find out what's wrong with the old man. This could be a physical ailment, emotional distress, or mental health issues. If it's a physical problem, it might be necessary to get a medical professional involved. If it's emotional or mental, a psychologist or counselor might be required.\n\n2. Develop a Treatment Plan: Once we know what the problem is, we can develop a plan to address it. This might involve medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. The plan should be developed in consultation with the old man and any relevant medical professionals.\n\n3. Implement the Plan: Once the plan is developed, it's time to put it into action. This could involve regular doctor's visits, therapy sessions, or medication. It's important to monitor the old man's progress and adjust the plan as necessary.\n\n4. Provide Support: Healing can be a difficult process, and the old man will likely need support. This could involve providing emotional support, helping with daily tasks, or ensuring he has access to necessary resources.\n\n5. Monitor Progress: Regularly check in with the old man to see how he's doing. If the plan isn't working, it might be necessary to adjust it or try a different approach. \n\n6. Continue Treatment: Healing often takes time, so it's important to continue the treatment plan even if progress is slow. Patience and persistence are key.\n\nRemember, it's important to respect the old man's autonomy and wishes throughout this process. He should be involved in every step of the process and his comfort and wellbeing should be the top priority."

The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:make\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action make_drill\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?wood - wood ?drill - drill)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_wood ?npc ?wood)\n                    (not (has_drill ?npc)))\n    :effect (and\n              (has_drill ?npc ?drill)\n              (not (has_wood ?npc ?wood)))\n  )\n\n\n(:action make_solar_still\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?container - container ?plastic_sheet - plastic_sheet ?hole - hole)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?npc)\n                    (has_container ?container)\n                    (has_plastic_sheet ?plastic_sheet)\n                    (dug_hole ?hole))\n    :effect (and\n              (constructed_solar_still ?hole)\n              (distilled_water ?container))\n  )\n```\n\n### Descriptions of Actions:\n\n1. **make_drill**: This action involves creating a drill using available wood resources.\n2. **collect_rain_water**: This action allows the NPC to collect rainwater in the rainforest.\n3. **create_fire**: This action involves starting a fire in the jungle to prepare for boiling water.\n4. **boil_water**: This action makes water safe to drink by boiling it after filtering through fabric.\n5. **make_solar_still**: This action involves constructing a solar still to distill water using a container and a plastic sheet.\n\nThese actions are designed to align with the task of collecting and making water safe to drink in a jungle environment.\n(:action make_spear\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?spear - object ?wood - material)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (has_material ?npc ?wood) (location ?location jungle))\n    :effect (and (has_spear ?npc ?spear))\n)\n\n\n(:action create_fire\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?jungle - jungle)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (in_jungle ?npc ?jungle)\n                    (has_drill ?npc ?drill)\n                    (has_wood ?npc ?wood))\n    :effect (and\n              (fire_created ?npc ?jungle)\n              (not (has_wood ?npc ?wood))\n              (not (has_drill ?npc ?drill)))\n  )\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **make_drill**: This action involves making a drill using wood. The precondition is that the NPC has wood and does not already have a drill. The effect is that the NPC now has a drill and no longer has the wood.\n- **collect_rain_water**: This action involves collecting rainwater in the rainforest. The precondition is that the NPC is in the rainforest and has an empty container. The effect is that the NPC has collected water in the container, making it no longer empty.\n- **create_fire**: This action involves creating a fire in the jungle. The precondition is that the NPC is in the jungle, has a drill, and has wood. The effect is that a fire is created, and the NPC no longer has the wood or the drill.\n\nThese actions are tailored to the task of making a fire and collecting water, based on the provided steps and descriptions.\n(:action build_shelter\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?c - camp ?s - stick)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?n ?c)\n                    (available ?s)\n                    (not (shelter_built ?c))\n                  )\n    :effect (shelter_built ?c)\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Collect Rain Water\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

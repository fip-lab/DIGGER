    "\nYou're a professional AI, and you're able to combine multiple PDDL actions into one universal action. The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:stay\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action stay_in_shelter\n    :parameters (?npc - agent)\n    :precondition (and (shelterAvailable ?npc) (stocked ?npc ?food))\n    :effect (and (sheltered ?npc) (not (exposed ?npc)))\n)\n```\n**Explanation**: This action represents the NPC staying in a shelter. The precondition ensures that the NPC has access to a shelter and has already stocked up on food. The effect indicates that the NPC is now sheltered and no longer exposed to outside conditions.\n\nThese actions capture the essence of preparing for a potential nuclear attack by gathering essential food supplies and staying sheltered.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The precondition checks that the food is non-perishable and in storage, and that the NPC is available to collect it. The effect reflects that the food is now stocked by the NPC and no longer in storage.\n\n#### Action 2: stay_in_shelter\n```lisp\n\nThe actions after the merger are:"

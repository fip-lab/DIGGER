It hydrates the person and removes the person from the water source.\n- **carve_groove**: This action involves the person carving a groove in the wood using a rock. The rock must be sharp, and the action results in the wood having a groove and the rock losing its sharpness.\n- **check_water**: This action involves an NPC checking the water in the river.

Preconditions ensure the NPC is on the island and the water is available. The effect is that the NPC now has the water, and it is no longer available (assumed to be limited supply).\n\n2. **carve_groove**: This action involves a person using a rock to carve a groove into a piece of wood. Preconditions ensure the person has both the rock and the wood and is on the island. The effect is that the wood now has a groove, and the material (wood) is used up.\n\n3. **ration_supplies**: This action is about rationing the water supplies. Preconditions ensure that the person has the water and is on the island. The effect is that the water is now rationed.\n\n4. **hunt_for_food**: This action allows the person to hunt for food on the island. Preconditions ensure the person is on the island.

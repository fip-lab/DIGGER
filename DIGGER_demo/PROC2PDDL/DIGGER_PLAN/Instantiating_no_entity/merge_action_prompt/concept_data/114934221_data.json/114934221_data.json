The NPC must be aware of the shark's presence to defend effectively. The effect is that the shark retreats, and the NPC is no longer threatened.\n\n- **Attack shark**: This action represents the NPC actively attacking the shark to make it retreat. Preconditions include the NPC being threatened by the shark. The effect is similar to the defense action, ensuring the shark retreats.\n\n- **Board ship**: This action is the ultimate goal, where the NPC boards the ship after ensuring that the shark has retreated. The precondition is that the NPC is in the deep sea, and the effect is that they are now on the ship.\n\nThese actions incorporate the task of boarding a ship while considering the threat posed by sharks, as described in the task and descriptions provided.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

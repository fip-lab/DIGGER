The preconditions ensure the npc is at the beach and has the necessary materials. The effect is the raft being built, and the materials no longer being available.\n\n- **create_rescue_signal**: This action allows the npc to create a rescue signal at the beach location. The preconditions check that the npc is at the beach and has the necessary materials for the signal. The effect is the signal being created and the materials being used up.\n\nThese actions are designed to reflect the task of building a raft and potentially creating a rescue signal, aligning with the provided description."

If there were more steps or detailed descriptions, additional actions could be generated to cover other aspects of shelter creation."

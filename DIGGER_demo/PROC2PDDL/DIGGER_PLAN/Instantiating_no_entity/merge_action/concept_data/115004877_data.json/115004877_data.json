Preconditions check that the work station currently has wet linen and contains papyrus. The effect is that the wet linen is replaced with dry linen.\n\n2. **lay_strips**: This action involves laying the second half of the strips horizontally on top of vertically laid strips. Preconditions ensure that the first half is laid vertically and the strips are not yet laid. The effect is that the strips are laid horizontally.\n\n3. **laid_strips**: This action involves laying papyrus plant strips on a hard, flat surface. Preconditions ensure that the surface is hard and flat and the strips are not yet laid. The effect is that the strips are laid without overlapping.\n\n4. **dip_strips**: This action involves dipping strips into a glue and water mixture. Preconditions ensure the presence of the mixture and that the strips are not yet soaked. The effect is that the strips become soaked and flat.\n\nThese actions capture the logic and intent of each step in the task \"process-strips\" based on the descriptions provided."

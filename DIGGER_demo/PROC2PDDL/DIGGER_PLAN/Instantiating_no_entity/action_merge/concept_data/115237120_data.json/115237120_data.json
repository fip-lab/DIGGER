    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, I'll focus on creating an abstract and generalizable action named \"get\". This action will be designed to handle various scenarios including seeking shelter, gathering first aid supplies, or any other task involving acquiring an item or reaching a state of safety. \n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```\n(:action get ; Acquire an item or reach a state of safety\n  :parameters (?npc - character ?target - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and\n    (available ?npc)\n    (not (acquired ?npc ?target))\n    (in_area ?npc ?location))\n  :effect (and\n    (acquired ?npc ?target)\n    (safe ?npc))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name:** get\n- **Parameters:**\n  - ?npc (the person or agent performing the action)\n  - ?target (the object or state being sought, e.g., a first aid kit, shelter, or water)\n  - ?location (the location related to the action, e.g., a building, a storage area)\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - The NPC must be available (available ?npc).\n  - The NPC must not have already acquired the target (not (acquired ?npc ?target)).\n  - The NPC must be in the area of the location (in_area ?npc ?location).\n- **Effects:**\n  - The NPC has now acquired the target (acquired ?npc ?target).\n  - The NPC is safe (safe ?npc).\n\n### State Change:\nThe action captures the state change of the NPC acquiring a target (an object, resource, or state) and becoming safe.\n\n### Core Logic:\nThe core logic of the preconditions and effects is retained, ensuring that the action is simple yet powerful enough to handle a variety of tasks.\n\n### Avoid Redundancy:\nBy combining similar actions into this general \"get\" action, we avoid redundancy and ensure simplicity and efficiency.\n\n### Logical Consistency:\nThe preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring clarity and reasonableness in various contexts.",
    "To create a merged action named \"purify\" from the given action set, we need to follow the guidelines provided for combining the actions. Since we only have one action, \"purify_water,\" to work with, we can use its structure as the basis for the merged action. Here's how we can structure it:\n\n### Merged Action: Purify\n\n```pddl\n(:action purify ; Purify a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?entity - resource ?method1 - method ?method2 - method)\n    :precondition (and\n      (impure ?entity)\n      (available ?method1)\n      (available ?method2)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (pure ?entity)\n      (not (impure ?entity))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters are generalized to `?entity`, which represents any resource that can be purified.\n   - The methods used for purification are abstracted as `?method1` and `?method2`, allowing for flexibility in what methods might be applied.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions check if the resource is impure and if the necessary purification methods are available.\n   - The effects transition the resource from an impure state to a pure state.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency:**\n   - The single action captures the essence of the purification process, focusing on the availability of methods and the state change of the resource.\n   - Unnecessary complexity is avoided by not specifying particular methods or resources, thus allowing for a broader application.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring the preconditions and effects are directly related to the state change of the resource, adhering to a straightforward and reasonable transformation process. \n\nThis merged action is adaptable to various purification tasks, maintaining a clear logic and efficiency while achieving the desired transformation of the entity's state.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we will create a generalized \"drink\" action. This action should be adaptable to various contexts involving drinking and its associated state changes. Here's how we can structure the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: Drink\n\n```lisp\n(:action drink ; Consume a resource to alleviate a need\n  :parameters (?npc - entity ?liquid - resource)\n  :precondition (and \n    (safe_to_consume ?liquid)\n    (needs_hydration ?npc)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (not (needs_hydration ?npc))\n    (hydrated ?npc)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?npc` and `?liquid`) so that it can apply to various tasks involving drinking or consuming some resource for hydration.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the liquid resource is safe to consume and that the entity needs hydration. The effects specify that the entity's state changes from needing hydration to being hydrated.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is maintained without unnecessary complexity. The action checks if the entity needs hydration and if the resource is safe to consume, then updates the entity's state to hydrated.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The merged action combines similar effects related to drinking, ensuring simplicity. Any action involving drinking would follow this general logic.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent across different tasks. The logic is clear: if an entity needs hydration and the resource is safe, then consuming it will hydrate the entity.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various contexts by changing the specific instances of `?npc` and `?liquid`, making it a universal action for tasks involving drinking or consuming for hydration.",
    "(:action learn ; Learn a skill or gather necessary resources\n  :parameters (?npc - entity ?resource - object ?skill - skill)\n  :precondition (and\n    (has_resource ?resource)\n    (not (has_skill ?npc ?skill))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (has_skill ?npc ?skill)\n  )\n)\n\n;;; The merged action \"learn\" allows an entity to acquire a skill or gather necessary resources, ensuring the precondition of having the required resource and the absence of the skill before learning. The effect is the acquisition of the skill by the entity."

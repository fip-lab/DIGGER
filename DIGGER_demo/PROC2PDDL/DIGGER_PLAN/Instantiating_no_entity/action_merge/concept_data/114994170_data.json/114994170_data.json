    "Here's the merged PDDL action based on the provided sets of actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action fill\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?container - object ?location - place ?resource - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (located ?container ?location)\n                    (present ?agent ?location)\n                    (empty ?container)\n                    (available ?resource ?location))\n    :effect (and\n              (filled ?container)\n              (not (empty ?container))\n              (used ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Action Name:** `fill` - This action can be used to fill a container with a resource, applicable to various scenarios such as filling a bathtub with water, covering mouth and nose with a mask, or securing an NPC in a location.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `?agent` - represents the person or agent performing the action.\n  - `?container` - represents the object to be filled.\n  - `?location` - represents the place where the action occurs.\n  - `?resource` - represents the resource being used to fill the container.\n- **Preconditions:**\n  - `located ?container ?location` - The container must be located at the specified location.\n  - `present ?agent ?location` - The agent must be present at the specified location.\n  - `empty ?container` - The container must be empty before the action.\n  - `available ?resource ?location` - The resource must be available at the specified location.\n- **Effects:**\n  - `filled ?container` - The container will be filled after the action.\n  - `not (empty ?container)` - The container will no longer be empty.\n  - `used ?resource` - The resource will be marked as used.\n\nThis merged action maintains generality and logical consistency, ensuring it can be adapted to a variety of tasks while avoiding redundancy and complexity.",
    "Given the provided actions and the goal of merging them into a single, universal action that maintains generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, the merged action for the task \"get\" would look like this:\n\nAction name after merge: get\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n```lisp\n(:action get_resource\n    :parameters (?npc - entity ?resource - item ?source - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?npc)\n                    (contains ?source ?resource)\n                    (present ?npc ?source))\n    :effect (and\n              (has ?npc ?resource)\n              (decreased ?source ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters are defined abstractly as `?npc - entity`, `?resource - item`, and `?source - object`, which can be applied to a variety of tasks beyond just water collection.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions check that the NPC (or entity) is available, that the source object contains the resource, and that the NPC is present at the source. The effects ensure that the NPC gains the resource and that the source's resource quantity decreases.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is streamlined to avoid any unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core logic of obtaining a resource from a source.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the essence of the original actions while being adaptable to various tasks involving obtaining resources.",
    "Based on the provided action sets and the guidelines for merging them into a single universal action, here is the combined \"check\" action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action check ; Check a resource and update task status\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (available ?npc)\n                  (not (checked ?npc ?item))\n                  (at ?npc ?location)\n                 )\n  :effect (checked ?npc ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?npc`, `?item`, and `?location`) making it applicable to a variety of tasks involving different resources (e.g., books, radios, batteries).\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. For example, the action checks if the resource is available, not already checked, and if the agent is at the correct location before marking the item as checked.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single action. The parameters are kept abstract to cover a broad range of scenarios.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. The `checked` effect serves as a common state change applicable to various resources.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible and efficient way to handle different checking tasks while ensuring clarity and logical consistency.",
    "Based on the provided task and guidelines, the actions related to turning on the radio can be merged into a single, more abstract and universal action. The merged action should follow the principles of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action turn ; Turn on a device and update its state\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?device - object)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (checked ?npc ?device)\n                  (functional ?device)\n                  (not (on ?device))\n                )\n  :effect (and\n           (on ?device)\n           (using ?npc ?device)\n          )\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The action is named `turn` and uses abstract parameters `?npc` (agent) and `?device` (object), making it adaptable to various tasks beyond just turning on a radio.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions include checks to ensure the device is functional and has been checked by the NPC. The effect updates the state to indicate the device is now on and being used by the NPC.\n- **Simplicity:** The action is concise and avoids redundancy by combining the necessary checks and state changes into one action.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains a clear and reasonable logic, ensuring that the device can only be turned on if it has been checked and is functional, reflecting a consistent and logical progression of states.\n\nThis merged action meets the objective of combining multiple tasks into a single, efficient, and adaptable action suitable for various contexts."

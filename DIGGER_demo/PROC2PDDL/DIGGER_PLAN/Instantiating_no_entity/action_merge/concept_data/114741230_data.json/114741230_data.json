    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named `initiate`, we will focus on maintaining generality, clear state changes, simplicity, avoiding redundancy, and logical consistency. Below is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action initiate ;  Initiate a process or membership and update status\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?entity - entity)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (not (initiated ?npc ?entity))\n                  (closest-friend ?npc)\n                  (not (formed ?entity)))\n  :effect (and \n            (initiated ?npc ?entity)\n            (formed ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n#### Generality:\n- The parameters are abstracted to `?npc - person` and `?entity - entity` to ensure the action can apply to a wide variety of tasks, not just specific ones.\n- `entity` could refer to a secret society, a club, a group, or any other entity relevant to the context.\n\n#### State Change:\n- Preconditions and effects clearly describe the change. The entity is initiated and formed through the action.\n\n#### Simplicity:\n- Redundant conditions are removed, and the action is kept straightforward, ensuring it is simple and efficient.\n\n#### Logical Consistency:\n- The action maintains consistent logic with clear preconditions and effects, ensuring reasonable and coherent transitions for different contexts.\n\n### Addressing the Original Actions:\n\n1. **Initiate New Member:**\n    ```pddl\n    (:action initiate_new_member\n        :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - secret_society)\n        :precondition (and\n                        (not (member-initiated ?npc ?ss))\n                        (closest-friend ?npc)\n                        (not (society-formed ?ss)))\n        :effect (and\n                  (member-initiated ?npc ?ss)\n                  (society-formed ?ss))\n      )\n    ```\n\n2. **Set Meeting Location:**\n    - The `Set Meeting Location` action is not provided in the prompt. However, the merged action remains adaptable for additional tasks involving initiation and status update.\n\nBy ensuring the merged action retains the core logic of the original actions, defines a clear state change, and uses abstract parameters, we maintain generality, simplicity, and logical consistency across different contexts.",
    "To merge the given actions under the \"set\" objective, we need to identify the commonalities and differences in their parameters, preconditions, and effects. The goal is to create a universal action that can accommodate the setting of various attributes within a secret society context. Here's how the merged action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action set\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ss - secret_society ?attribute - attribute)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (society-formed ?ss)\n                    (not (set ?ss ?attribute)))\n    :effect (set ?ss ?attribute)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses the parameter `?attribute` to represent any attribute that needs to be set (e.g., meeting location, dress code). This abstraction allows the action to apply to various tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures that the society is formed and that the specific attribute has not yet been set.\n   - The effect marks the attribute as set.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is streamlined by using a single abstract parameter (`?attribute`) instead of separate actions for each specific attribute.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logic remains consistent across different contexts by maintaining the core requirement that the society must be formed and the attribute must not yet be set before executing the action.\n\nThis merged action can be easily adapted to different settings by specifying the `?attribute` parameter, making it versatile and efficient for a range of tasks related to setting attributes in a secret society.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"create\" while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can formulate the following action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action create ; Create an entity or attribute within a context\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item - entity ?context - context)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (initiated ?npc)\n                  (belongs-to ?item ?context)\n                  (not (created ?item ?context)))\n  :effect (created ?item ?context))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters like `?npc`, `?item`, and `?context` to apply to a variety of tasks. This allows for the creation of different entities or attributes within any given context.\n   - The `?item` parameter can represent different types of entities, such as members, names, or secrets, and `?context` can represent contexts like a secret society or any other relevant grouping.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions involve checking if the `?npc` has initiated the creation and if the `?item` belongs to the `?context`, ensuring logical applicability across scenarios.\n   - The effect clearly indicates a state change where the entity or attribute represented by `?item` is marked as created within the `?context`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancies are removed by using the general concept of `created` rather than specific terms like `member-created` or `name-created`.\n   - This simplification helps in maintaining a clean and efficient action definition.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent across different tasks, ensuring that the action can be applied logically in varied contexts.\n   - The conditions ensure that the creation only occurs if it hasn't been done before, avoiding duplications and maintaining logical flow.\n\nBy framing the merged action in this way, it becomes versatile and applicable to various tasks that involve the creation of entities or attributes while maintaining logical coherence and simplicity.",
    "To create a merged action named \"teach\" that combines the provided actions \"teach_new_member_secret\" and \"create_name\", we need to ensure that the merged action is general, captures the state change, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: teach\n\n```lisp\n(:action teach\n  ; Teach a member and update their knowledge or status in an organization\n  :parameters (?teacher - person ?student - person ?org - organization ?info - information)\n  \n  :precondition (and\n                  (member-initiated ?student ?org)\n                  (not (knows ?student ?info ?org))\n                  (can-teach ?teacher ?info ?org))\n  \n  :effect (knows ?student ?info ?org)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters like `?teacher`, `?student`, `?org`, and `?info` to generalize the action for various teaching scenarios, beyond specific secrets or names.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly outline the state changes. If a student is initiated but doesn't know specific information, and a teacher can teach, the student will then know the information.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic from the original actions is preserved. The conditions for being able to teach and the result of the teaching process are maintained.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: The action combines the teaching and learning processes into one, eliminating redundancy.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"teach\" is now adaptable to a variety of tasks involving teaching and learning within an organization.",
    "Based on your requirements and the actions provided, the merged action for the \"read\" task should encapsulate the key elements of checking or reading information from a resource and updating the state to reflect that the information has been read. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action read ;  Read information from a resource and update status\n:parameters (?npc - person ?resource - entity)\n:precondition (and (available ?npc) (not (info-read ?npc ?resource)))\n:effect (info-read ?npc ?resource))\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how this merged action aligns with your guidelines:\n\n**Generality**: \n- The action uses abstract parameters (?npc and ?resource) to ensure it is adaptable to a variety of tasks, not limited to specific types of actions.\n\n**State Change**:\n- The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The precondition checks if the information has not been read yet, and the effect updates the status to indicate that the information has been read.\n\n**Simplicity**:\n- The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single, efficient action.\n\n**Logical Consistency**:\n- The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different contexts. The logic is straightforward: if an NPC is available and the information has not been read, then after the action, the information is marked as read.\n\nThis merged action is not tied to specific resources or tasks, making it versatile for various scenarios where reading or checking information and updating the status is required."

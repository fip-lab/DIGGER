    "\nTo merge these actions into a single, universal \"gather\" action while ensuring generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we can create an abstracted action that captures the essence of gathering various resources. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action gather\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?resource - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?location)\n                    (available ?location ?resource)\n                    (not (collected ?agent ?resource))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (collected ?agent ?resource)\n              (not (available ?location ?resource))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name**: `gather` - This name is generic and indicates the action of collecting or obtaining resources.\n  \n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?agent` - Represents any entity capable of gathering (could be a person, NPC, etc.).\n  - `?resource` - Represents any object that can be gathered (materials, water, etc.).\n  - `?location` - Represents the place where the resource is located.\n\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(at ?agent ?location)`: The agent must be at the specified location to gather the resource.\n  - `(available ?location ?resource)`: The resource must be available at the location.\n  - `(not (collected ?agent ?resource))`: The resource should not have been collected by the agent already.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(collected ?agent ?resource)`: The resource is now collected by the agent.\n  - `(not (available ?location ?resource))`: The resource is no longer available at the location, reflecting its collection.\n\nThis merged action maintains the core logic of the original actions but abstracts them into a more generalized form that can be applied across different contexts and tasks involving gathering resources.",
    "The task is to merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"create.\" This merged action should be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving creation, such as creating a shelter or starting a fire, while maintaining generality, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nLet's analyze and merge the given actions:\n\n### Actions to be Merged\n\n1. **create-shelter**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action create-shelter\n       :parameters (?p - person ?l - location)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (at ?p ?l)\n                       (material_collected ?p tinder)\n                       (not (shelter_built ?l))\n                      )\n       :effect (shelter_built ?l)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **create_shelter**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action create_shelter\n       :parameters (?npc - npc ?location - location ?tinder - tinder)\n       :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (collected ?tinder))\n       :effect (and (shelter_created ?location) (not (collected ?tinder)))\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action\n\nThe merged action, named \"create,\" should be abstract and flexible enough to handle the creation of various resources, focusing on the core logic of checking preconditions and applying effects:\n\n```pddl\n(:action create ; Create a resource in a location\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?location - location ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?location)\n                    (material_collected ?agent ?resource)\n                    (not (resource_created ?location))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n             (resource_created ?location)\n             (not (material_collected ?agent ?resource))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: The use of abstract parameters like `?agent`, `?location`, and `?resource` allows the action to be used for creating various resources, not limited to shelters or fire.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions check if the agent is at the location and has collected the necessary materials, while the effects indicate the resource is created and materials are used.\n- **Simplicity**: By using a single `resource_created` predicate, we avoid redundancy and simplify the logic.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistently applied to ensure logical transformations across various contexts.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable and maintains core logic, making it suitable for a wide range of creation tasks.",
    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action, we need to ensure the resulting action maintains generality, captures state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. The merged action will be named `start` and will be designed to handle a variety of tasks such as starting a fire or initiating a process. Here\u2019s how the action can be defined:\n\n### Action name after merge: start\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n1. **start-fire**:\n```pddl\n(:action start_fire\n    :parameters (?p - person ?m - material)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (material_collected ?p ?m)\n                    (shelter_built beach)\n                    (not (fire_started beach))\n                   )\n    :effect (fire_started beach)\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action start\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?resource - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?actor)\n                    (prepared ?actor ?resource)\n                    (at ?actor ?location)\n                    (not (started ?location))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (started ?location)\n              (not (prepared ?actor ?resource))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The `start` action uses abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?resource`, and `?location` to ensure it can be applied to various tasks. This avoids limiting the action to specific scenarios such as starting a fire.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. For example, the action requires that the `?actor` is available and has a prepared `?resource` at a specific `?location`, and upon execution, it marks the `?location` as started and the `?resource` as no longer prepared.\n3. **Core Logic**: The preconditions and effects retain the core logic of the original actions, ensuring that necessary conditions are met before the action can be executed.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By combining similar actions into a single action with abstract parameters, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action `start` can be used in various contexts, such as starting a fire, initiating a process, or beginning any task that requires preparation and specific conditions.",
    "Given the task to merge actions into a single universal action named \"wet,\" we need to follow the guidelines provided to ensure generality, clear state changes, simplicity, and logical consistency. We will modify and merge the actions while maintaining the core logic and avoiding redundancy.\n\nLet's proceed with the merge:\n\n### Actions to be merged:\n1. Wet Tinder:\n```pddl\n(:action wet_tinder\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?tinder - tinder)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc water-source) (dry ?tinder))\n    :effect (and (wet ?tinder) (not (dry ?tinder)))\n)\n```\n\n2. Put Object in Receptacle (modified to be relevant):\n```pddl\n(:action put_object_in_receptacle\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?object - object ?receptacle - receptacle)\n    :precondition (and (holding ?npc ?object) (empty ?receptacle))\n    :effect (and (in ?object ?receptacle) (not (holding ?npc ?object)))\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action wet\n    ; Wet an item or put an object in a receptacle\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?item - object ?receptacle - receptacle)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc water-source) (or (dry ?item) (and (holding ?npc ?item) (empty ?receptacle))))\n    :effect (and (or (and (wet ?item) (not (dry ?item))) (and (in ?item ?receptacle) (not (holding ?npc ?item)))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"wet\" uses abstract parameters (?npc, ?item, ?receptacle) making it adaptable to a variety of tasks, including wetting an item and placing an object in a receptacle.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the state changes clearly. If the item is dry, it becomes wet. If the object is being held and the receptacle is empty, the object is placed into the receptacle.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action removes redundancy by combining similar effects into a single action. The logic is straightforward and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions ensure that the action is only applicable when the conditions are met (e.g., at the water source for wetting, holding the object for placing it in the receptacle). The effects maintain reasonable state changes.\n\nThis merged action \"wet\" should now be adaptable to multiple contexts involving wetting items or placing objects in receptacles, adhering to the guidelines provided."

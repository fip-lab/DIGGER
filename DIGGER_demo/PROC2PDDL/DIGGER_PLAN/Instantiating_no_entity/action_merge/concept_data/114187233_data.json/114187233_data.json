    "To create a universal \"peel\" action from the given set of PDDL actions, we need to focus on combining the steps related to peeling and draining coconuts while maintaining generality and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action peel\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?coconut - coconut ?tool - tool ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (or (has_outer_casing ?coconut) (wrapped ?coconut ?tool))\n                  (sharp ?tool)\n                  (not (peeled ?coconut))\n                  (empty ?container))\n  :effect (and\n            (peeled ?coconut)\n            (exposed_shell ?coconut)\n            (drained ?coconut)\n            (filled ?container)\n            (not (has_outer_casing ?coconut))\n            (not (empty ?container))))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?coconut`, `?tool`, `?container`) to ensure adaptability to various similar tasks involving agents and tools.\n\n2. **Preconditions**: \n   - The coconut must either have an outer casing or be wrapped, requiring a sharp tool to proceed.\n   - The tool must be sharp to peel the coconut.\n   - The container must be empty to capture the drained contents.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - The coconut becomes peeled, and its shell is exposed.\n   - The coconut is drained, filling the container, and ensuring the container is no longer empty.\n\n4. **Simplicity and Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action efficiently combines peeling and draining steps, avoiding redundancy by using universally applicable parameters and effects.\n   - Preconditions and effects ensure a clear and logical transformation from the initial to the goal state, applicable to various scenarios of coconut processing.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the peeling and draining process, providing a reusable template for similar tasks.",
    "Here is the merged action combining the wrapping actions into a single universal action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action wrap\n    :parameters (?item - object ?cover - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (wrapped ?item ?cover))\n                    (or (and (coconut ?item) (coconut_intact ?item))\n                        (drained ?item)\n                    )\n                    (clean ?cover)\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (wrapped ?item ?cover)\n              (not (clean ?cover))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n- **Generality:** The action uses abstract parameters `?item` and `?cover` to generalize the task of wrapping, which can be applied to various objects, not just coconuts and towels.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions reflect the necessary state before the action can be performed, and the effects clearly indicate the changes in the state, i.e., the item becomes wrapped and the cover is no longer clean.\n- **Simplicity:** By merging the conditions from different actions, redundancy is avoided. The conditions are combined using logical OR where applicable.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The merged action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring that the action remains applicable in different contexts and captures the core logic of the original actions.\n\nThis universal `wrap` action can now be used to wrap a variety of objects under different preconditions, making it adaptable to multiple tasks.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"smash\" while ensuring generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract and streamline the parameters, preconditions, and effects of the provided actions. Here's how you can combine these actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action smash\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (prepared ?item)\n                    (usable ?tool)\n                    (not (processed ?item))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n             (processed ?item)\n             (not (prepared ?item))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is named \"smash\" to reflect a broad applicability to various tasks involving breaking or processing an item.\n   - Parameters are abstracted to `?npc` (person involved), `?item` (object being processed), and `?tool` (tool used), making it adaptable to different contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the item is prepared (analogous to being wrapped, peeled, and drained) and that the tool is usable (e.g., a heavy hammer).\n   - Effects change the state of the item to processed (analogous to being smashed or broken) and remove the prepared state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions are removed, and similar effects are merged under broader terms like `prepared` and `processed` to simplify the action.\n   - This abstraction removes unnecessary complexity while maintaining the core logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains logical consistency across different contexts by using broad terms that encompass the required preconditions and effects.\n   - The action ensures that the item transitions from a prepared state to a processed state, which is consistent with the task of smashing or breaking.\n\nThis merged action \"smash\" can now be applied to a variety of tasks involving the preparation and processing of an object with a tool, capturing the essential logic of the original actions while maintaining adaptability and simplicity."

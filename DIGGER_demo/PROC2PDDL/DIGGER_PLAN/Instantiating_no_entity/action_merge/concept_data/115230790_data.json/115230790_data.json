    "To create a merged action named \"move\" from the given action set, we'll follow the guidelines provided to ensure generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action move ; Move an entity from one location to another, ensuring safety and updating location status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?from - location ?to - location ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and\n                 (at_location ?entity ?from)\n                 (safe ?to))\n  :effect (and\n           (at_location ?entity ?to)\n           (in_container ?entity ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters have been abstracted to `?entity - object`, `?from - location`, `?to - location`, and `?container - container` to make the action applicable to a wide range of scenarios, not just involving NPCs and bunkers.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure the entity is at the `?from` location and the `?to` location is safe.\n   - The effects update the entity's location to `?to` and note that the entity is in a `?container`, reflecting the new state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is kept simple by directly mapping the preconditions and effects without additional unnecessary conditions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable for any context where moving an entity while ensuring safety is required.\n\nThis merged action should provide a flexible and efficient solution for moving tasks in a PDDL domain.",
    "Sure, I can help you merge these actions into one universal action called \"check\". Let's combine them while ensuring the guidelines are followed.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action check ; Check a resource and update task status\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?entity)\n                    (or \n                        (and (at_home ?entity ?item)\n                             (not (informed ?entity)))\n                        (and (stocked ?item)\n                             (informed ?entity))\n                        (and (has_bunker ?entity ?item)\n                             (prepared ?item))\n                        (and (has_weapon ?entity ?item)\n                             (has_ammunition ?entity ?ammunition))\n                        (and (available ?entity)\n                             (not (checked ?entity ?item)))\n                    ))\n    :effect (and\n             (or (informed ?entity)\n                 (checked ?item))\n             (checked ?entity ?item))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Generality:** The parameters are abstract (`?entity`, `?item`, `?ammunition`), making the action adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions describe the necessary state before the action, and the effects describe the state changes. The goal is reached progressively by checking and updating the status.\n- **Simplicity:** Similar effects and preconditions are merged to avoid redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency:** Preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action is designed to accommodate the different scenarios described in the provided actions, making it versatile and efficient for various tasks.",
    "(:action wait ; Wait for a condition to be met or for a period of time\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?location - place ?condition - condition)\n  :precondition (and (or (early_reports ?npc) (in_bunker ?npc ?location)) (not (met ?condition)))\n  :effect (and (or (unified_reports ?npc) (isolated ?npc)) (met ?condition))\n)",

The effect `(has ?npc ?item)` indicates that the npc now possesses the item.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action is simple and removes unnecessary complexities, focusing on the core logic of the preconditions and effects.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic, ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts.",
    "Alright, let's merge the provided actions into a single, universal action named \"outfit\". We will ensure that the merged action remains abstract, adaptable to multiple tasks, captures state changes, and maintains logical consistency without redundancy. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action outfit\n  ; Outfit an entity with a resource and update its state\n  :parameters (?entity - entity ?resource - resource ?npc - person)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (in_location ?npc ?entity)\n                  (has_resource ?npc ?resource)\n                  (not (outfitted ?entity ?resource)))\n  :effect (and\n            (outfitted ?entity ?resource)\n            (prepared ?entity)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The use of abstract parameters like `?entity` and `?resource` allows this action to apply to various tasks beyond just outfitting a bunker with an energy source.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly indicate the transformation of the entity's state. The entity needs to be in a location where the NPC is present and the NPC must have the resource. After the action, the entity is outfitted with the resource and marked as prepared.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action removes unnecessary complexity while remaining efficient and concise.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency, ensuring that the action can be applied to various contexts where an entity needs to be outfitted with a resource.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in a variety of scenarios involving outfitting entities with resources, whether it's a bunker with an energy source, a vehicle with fuel, or any other entity with a relevant resource."

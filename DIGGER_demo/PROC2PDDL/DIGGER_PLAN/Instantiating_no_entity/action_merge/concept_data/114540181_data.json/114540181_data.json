    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"make,\" we need to ensure the resulting action remains abstract, capturing the essence of each individual action while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity. Here\u2019s how the merged action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?resource - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and \n        (has ?npc ?resource)\n        (at ?npc ?location)\n        (suitable_conditions ?location ?resource))\n    :effect (and \n        (created ?location ?resource)\n        (not (deficient ?npc)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - **Parameters**: The action uses abstract parameters `?npc`, `?resource`, and `?location` to make it applicable to various scenarios involving creation tasks.\n   - This allows the action to be used in contexts like creating a solar water still, making a fire, or similar tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: Requires the NPC to have the necessary resource, be at the appropriate location, and that suitable conditions for creation are met. This reflects the specific needs of creating a solar water still, starting a fire, or gathering fruits.\n   - **Effects**: Indicates that the resource has been successfully created/made and that the NPC is no longer deficient in some need (e.g., dehydration or hunger).\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Retains the core logic of needing specific conditions and resources to achieve an outcome (creation of an object or state change), similar to how the solar water still and fire actions work.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By abstracting the conditions and effects, we prevent redundancy by using a single action that can adapt to different tasks without needing separate actions for similar processes.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects logically flow from the setup of the task to its completion, ensuring that the action can be reused in different contexts without losing meaning.\n\nThis merged \"make\" action provides a flexible framework to handle various creation tasks within the domain, allowing for adaptability and reusability across different scenarios.",
    "Given the instructions to merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"drink,\" we need to ensure the merged action is general, reflects state changes, is simple, and maintains logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action drink ; Drink a liquid and update the state of the person\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?liquid - liquid)\n  :precondition (and (thirsty ?npc) (has ?npc ?liquid) (safe_to_drink ?liquid))\n  :effect (and (not (thirsty ?npc)) (not (has ?npc ?liquid)) (hydrated ?npc))\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the core logic of the original `drink_water` action but is generalized to allow for any liquid that a person might drink, provided it is safe to drink. The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change, ensuring that the person is no longer thirsty, no longer has the liquid, and becomes hydrated. This approach maintains simplicity and avoids redundancy while being adaptable to various tasks involving drinking any liquid.",
    "Here's how we can merge the given action into a more general and universal action named `collect`:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```lisp\n(:action collect ; Collect resources and update their status\n    :parameters (?collector - person ?source1 - resource ?source2 - resource ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and (available ?collector) (provides ?source1) (provides ?source2) (empty ?container))\n    :effect (and (possess ?collector ?container) (filled_with ?container ?source1) (filled_with ?container ?source2) (not (empty ?container)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?collector`, `?source1`, `?source2`, and `?container` to apply to a variety of tasks involving the collection of resources. This allows the action to be used not only for collecting rainwater but potentially for other resource-gathering tasks as well.\n\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the state. Initially, the `?container` is empty, and upon the action's execution, it becomes filled with resources from `?source1` and `?source2`.\n\n- **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging the collection processes into a single action. By abstracting specific terms like `rainfall` to `provides`, the action retains simplicity and broad applicability.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains a consistent logic by ensuring that the resources are available from `?source1` and `?source2`, and the `?collector` is available to perform the task. The effects logically follow the preconditions, reflecting a filled state of the container.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action for boiling, we need to abstract the parameters, ensure the logic is consistent, and remove redundancy while maintaining the core logic of preconditions and effects. Here's how the merged action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action boil_resource\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?resource - object ?condition - condition)\n    :precondition (and (has ?npc ?resource) (can_process ?npc) (ready ?condition))\n    :effect (and (processed ?resource) (not (raw ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named `boil_resource` to indicate a generic process that can apply to various resources beyond just water.\n   - The parameters use abstract types: `?resource` for any object being processed, and `?condition` for any condition that needs to be met (e.g., fire, heat). This abstraction allows adaptability to various tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**: The person (`?npc`) must have the resource (`?resource`), be capable of processing it (`can_process ?npc`), and the condition (`?condition`) must be ready (e.g., fire is present).\n   - **Effects**: The resource becomes processed (`processed ?resource`), and it is no longer in its raw state (`not (raw ?resource)`), similar to the water becoming safe to drink.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are simplified by using generic predicates like `can_process` and `ready`, which can apply to different scenarios (e.g., boiling water, cooking food).\n   - The action avoids redundancy by merging the logic of creating a condition (like fire) and using it to process a resource.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains consistency by ensuring that the preconditions logically lead to the effects (i.e., having a resource and the necessary condition allows for processing the resource).\n\nBy abstracting the parameters and combining the core logic of the actions, this merged action can be adapted to various tasks that involve processing a resource under certain conditions."

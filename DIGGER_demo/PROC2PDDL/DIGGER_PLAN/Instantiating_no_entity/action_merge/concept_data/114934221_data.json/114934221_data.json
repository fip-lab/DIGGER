    "\nTo merge the given actions into a single, universal action while adhering to the guidelines, we can create an abstract action called `defend`. This merged action will be general, maintain logical consistency, represent the state change clearly, and avoid redundancy by capturing the essence of both original actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action defend\n  :parameters (?n - npc ?s - shark ?d - location ?sh - ship)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?n ?d)\n                  (at ?s ?d)\n                  (aware-of ?n ?s)\n                  (ship_status ?sh safe)\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n           (shark_location ?s deterred)\n           (shark-retreated ?s)\n           (not (threatened ?n ?s))\n           (ship_status ?sh defended)\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action `defend` is defined in a way that it can be applied in various contexts by using abstract parameters such as `?n` for NPC, `?s` for shark, `?d` for location, and `?sh` for ship. The action is not limited to specific scenarios and can be adapted to different defending tasks.\n\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The action starts by ensuring the NPC is aware of the shark's presence and that the ship is safe. The effects include the shark's location being deterred, the shark retreating, the NPC no longer being threatened, and the ship remaining defended.\n\n- **Simplicity**: The merged action removes unnecessary complexity by combining similar effects and ensuring that only essential conditions are included. Redundancy is avoided by integrating the logic of both actions into a concise representation.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains a consistent logic across different tasks, with preconditions and effects that make sense in the context of defending against a threat. The preconditions ensure the situation's readiness, and the effects ensure the successful defense of the location and the ship.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of defending in a variety of contexts, providing a flexible framework for handling similar tasks in a PDDL domain.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named `attack`, we need to ensure that the merged action is general, captures state changes clearly, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here's how the merged action could look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action attack ; Generalized attack action on a target in a location\n    :parameters (?attacker - agent ?target - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?attacker ?location)\n                    (at ?target ?location)\n                    (not (defended ?target))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (attacked ?target)\n              (not (defended ?target))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is named `attack` which can be used to represent any attack scenario, not just specific to sharks or ships.\n   - Parameters are abstracted to `?attacker`, `?target`, and `?location`, making the action adaptable to various contexts.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the attacker and target are at the same location and the target is not defended.\n   - The effect reflects a state change wherein the target is marked as attacked, and it is no longer defended.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - Retains the logic of the original actions where the attacker must be in the location of the target and the target must not be defended.\n   - The effect of the attack is to mark the target as attacked while removing any defended status.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - Similar effects from the original actions are merged into a single effect to simplify and streamline the logic.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains a consistent logical structure that applies broadly, making it suitable for a variety of attack scenarios.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible and efficient way to model attack scenarios in various domains while maintaining clarity and simplicity.",
    "To combine the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action, we will ensure the resulting action adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here\u2019s the merged action with the necessary preconditions and effects:\n\n```pddl\n(:action board\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?sh - ship ?d - deep_sea ?s - shark)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?n ?d)\n                    (threatened ?n ?s)\n                    (shark-retreated ?s))\n    :effect (and\n              (at ?n ?sh)\n              (not (at ?n ?d))\n              (not (threatened ?n ?s))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   The merged action `board` is designed to be general, allowing an NPC to board a ship while considering the threat from a shark. The parameters are abstract enough to apply to various tasks involving an NPC, a ship, the deep sea, and a shark.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - Preconditions include the NPC being in the deep sea (`at ?n ?d`), being threatened by a shark (`threatened ?n ?s`), and the shark must have retreated (`shark-retreated ?s`).\n   - The effect specifies that the NPC is now on the ship (`at ?n ?sh`), no longer in the deep sea (`not (at ?n ?d)`), and no longer threatened by the shark (`not (threatened ?n ?s)`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the necessary preconditions and effects of defending against, attacking, and ensuring the shark has retreated before boarding the ship.\n   - The action is efficient and straightforward, capturing the essential state changes without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action of boarding the ship occurs only if the NPC is in the deep sea, the shark threat is handled, and the NPC can transition to being on the ship.\n   - This maintains reasonable preconditions and effects across different contexts, such as varying scenarios with different NPCs, ships, and sharks.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `board` becomes a versatile and efficient way to handle the task of an NPC boarding a ship after dealing with a shark threat.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action that meets the outlined guidelines, we will create an action that encapsulates the general process of making or preparing an object, which can be adapted to various tasks. The merged action will ensure the state change is clearly defined, avoid redundancy, and maintain logical consistency.\n\nLet's analyze and merge the provided actions:\n\n### Actions to be Merged:\n\n1. **make_horizontal_bar**\n```lisp\n(:action make_horizontal_bar\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?spear_gun - weapon)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_weapon ?npc ?spear_gun)\n                    (weapon_ready ?spear_gun)\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n             (weapon_position ?spear_gun horizontal)\n             (ready_to_attack ?npc)\n            )\n)\n```\n\n2. **attack_ship**\n(Note: The description for `attack_ship` action is missing in the given text. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume a generic action that involves preparing a ship for an attack.)\n\n### Merged Action:\nWe'll create a universal action `make` that can be adapted for various tasks involving making or preparing an item or resource.\n\n```lisp\n(:action make ; Universal action to make or prepare a resource\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_resource ?npc ?item)\n                    (resource_ready ?item)\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n             (resource_state ?item ?state)\n             (ready ?npc)\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action `make` uses abstract parameters `?npc` (agent), `?item` (object), and `?state` (state) to increase applicability to various tasks.\n   - The action name and parameters are generalized to avoid being limited to specific types of actions.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions include having the resource and ensuring it is ready (`has_resource ?npc ?item` and `resource_ready ?item`).\n   - The effects clearly describe the state change of the resource (`resource_state ?item ?state`) and update the agent's readiness (`ready ?npc`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions are avoided by merging similar effects into a single effect.\n   - The merged action is concise and captures the core logic without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts by defining clear preconditions and effects.\n   - The preconditions and effects are reasonable and applicable to a variety of tasks.\n\nBy following the guidelines, we have created a merged action `make` that is adaptable, simple, and logically consistent for tasks involving making or preparing resources.",

    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named `place`, we follow the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. The merged action should be adaptable for placing various items in different contexts with clear preconditions and effects that reflect the state change. Here is the combined action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action place ; Place a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (not (placed ?item)) (setup ?item))\n    :effect (placed ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action `place` uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?item`, and `?location`) to ensure it can be applied to various tasks, such as placing a branch or setting up a snare.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the agent is at the specified location, the item is set up (if applicable), and the item has not already been placed.\n   - The effect indicates that the item has been placed, clearly reflecting the state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - By combining the actions, we remove redundancy and unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core logic of placing an item.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical flow of preconditions and effects is maintained, ensuring consistency across different tasks.\n\n### Original Actions:\n1. **place_branch**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action place_branch\n       :parameters (?npc - character ?wp - west_plain ?bp - branch_piece)\n       :precondition (and (at ?npc ?wp) (not (placed ?bp)))\n       :effect (placed ?bp)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **place_snare**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action place_snare\n       :parameters (?s - snare ?l - location)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (snare_setup ?s)\n                       (not (snare_placed ?s))\n                     )\n       :effect (snare_placed ?s)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action place ; Place a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (not (placed ?item)) (setup ?item))\n    :effect (placed ?item)\n)\n```\n\nThis merged action `place` is now a versatile and efficient way to handle various placement tasks in a consistent manner.",
    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action called \"get\", we need to follow the guidelines and generalize the parameters and preconditions/effects to make the action adaptable to various tasks. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action get ; Get a resource and update the entity's state\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - object)\n  :precondition (and\n    (npc_needs ?npc ?item)\n    (available ?item)\n    (not (npc_has ?npc ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (npc_has ?npc ?item)\n    (not (npc_needs ?npc ?item))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The parameters `(?npc - agent ?item - object)` are abstract enough to apply to various tasks involving agents and objects.\n    - This action can be adapted for tasks where an agent needs to acquire an object, which could be water, food, materials, etc.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The preconditions and effects clearly outline the change in state. If an agent needs an item and the item is available, the action results in the agent having the item and no longer needing it.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects and maintaining necessary preconditions.\n    - The logic is straightforward and applicable to multiple contexts.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The preconditions ensure that the action can only occur if the agent needs the item and the item is available.\n    - The effects update the state to reflect that the agent now has the item and no longer needs it.\n\nBy generalizing the parameters and combining similar actions, the \"get\" action can now be used for various tasks that involve acquiring resources and updating the entity's state accordingly.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action \"check\" that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, here is the combined action definition:\n\n```lisp\n(:action check ; Check a resource and update task status\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?task - task)\n    :precondition (and (available ?entity) (not (checked ?entity ?task)))\n    :effect (checked ?entity ?task)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?task` to adapt to various tasks and entities, thus ensuring it can be applied to different scenarios such as checking a snare, checking a book on the bestseller list, or listening to a member's suggestion in a book club.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(not (checked ?entity ?task))` ensures that the action can only be performed if the task has not been checked yet.\n   - The effect `(checked ?entity ?task)` signifies the transformation of the entity's state once the action is performed, indicating that the task has been checked.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single effect statement.\n   - It removes unnecessary complexity by abstracting specific actions into a more general form.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains consistent logic across different contexts by ensuring that the preconditions and effects clearly define the state transitions.\n   - It is logically consistent, ensuring that the `checked` status is only applicable when the entity is available and the task has not been previously checked.\n\nThis merged action \"check\" can now be applied to various tasks involving checking and updating the status of different entities, making it a versatile and efficient representation of the original actions.",

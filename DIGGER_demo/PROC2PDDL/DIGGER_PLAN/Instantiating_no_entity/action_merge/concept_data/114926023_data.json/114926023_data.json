    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action, we'll create a generalized action that captures the essence of creating something at a location using materials. This merged action will abstract the specific tasks of creating a raft and creating a rescue signal into a more adaptable form.\n\n### Merged Action: `create`\n\n```pddl\n(:action create\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?location - place ?creation - object ?materials - object)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?npc ?location)\n                    (has-materials ?npc ?materials)\n                    (location-type ?location beach))\n    :effect (and\n              (created ?creation)\n              (not (has-materials ?npc ?materials))\n             )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The action is generalized to apply to any creation task that involves an agent (`?npc`) using materials (`?materials`) at a specific location (`?location`) to create an object (`?creation`). The parameters are abstract, allowing the action to be applied to a variety of tasks beyond just raft building or signal creation.\n\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the agent is at the correct location and possesses the necessary materials. The effect reflects the state change by indicating the creation of the object and the consumption of the materials.\n\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic of checking location and materials is retained, while the specifics of what is being created are abstracted into parameters.\n\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action combines the similar effects of creating an object and using up materials, thus avoiding redundancy by not repeating the logic for each specific task.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and adaptable to different contexts, maintaining a clear and reasonable structure for creation tasks.",
    "To effectively merge the provided actions into a single universal action named `put`, we'll follow the guidelines to ensure generality, clarity in state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action put ; Place an item into a container\n  :parameters (?a - agent ?i - item ?c - container)\n  \n  :precondition (and \n                  (holding ?a ?i)\n                  (available ?c)\n                  (not (in ?i ?c))\n                )\n  \n  :effect (and \n            (not (holding ?a ?i))\n            (in ?i ?c)\n            (occupied ?c))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Action Name**: `put` - The action is named `put` to generalize the concept of placing one thing into another, which could apply to various contexts (e.g., putting an object into a receptacle, placing an item into a container).\n\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?a` - agent, representing the individual performing the action.\n  - `?i` - item, representing the object being placed.\n  - `?c` - container, representing the receptacle or location where the item is placed.\n\n- **Preconditions**: \n  - `(holding ?a ?i)` - The agent must be holding the item.\n  - `(available ?c)` - The container must be available to receive the item (a general condition that could replace specific states like `empty` to allow more flexibility).\n  - `(not (in ?i ?c))` - The item should not already be in the container, ensuring the action isn't redundant.\n\n- **Effects**: \n  - `(not (holding ?a ?i))` - The agent is no longer holding the item after placing it.\n  - `(in ?i ?c)` - The item is now in the container.\n  - `(occupied ?c)` - The container is now considered occupied (a general term that could be adapted to various contexts, including filled, used, or otherwise engaged).\n\nThis merged action is designed to be flexible, allowing its use in various scenarios involving placing items into containers, aligning with your guidelines for creating a universal action."

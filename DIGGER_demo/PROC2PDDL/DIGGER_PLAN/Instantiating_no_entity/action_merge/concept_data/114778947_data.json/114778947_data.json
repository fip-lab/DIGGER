    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks and retains logical consistency, we will follow the provided guidelines. Specifically, we will create an abstract set of parameters and ensure that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, reflecting the changes in state.\n\nBelow is the merged action for the given example actions:\n\nAction name after merge: hook\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n1. hook_latch\n```pddl\n(:action hook_latch\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?car - car)\n    :precondition (and\n      (hanger_in_car ?car)\n      (locked ?car)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (unlocked ?car)\n      (not (locked ?car))\n    )\n  )\n```\n2. straighten_coat_hanger\n```pddl\n(:action straighten_coat_hanger\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?hanger - hanger)\n    :precondition (and\n      (bent ?hanger)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (not (bent ?hanger))\n      (straight ?hanger))\n  )\n```\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n```pddl\n(:action hook ;  Perform a hooking-related task and update the state of the entity\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and\n      (or \n        (and (hanger_in_car ?target) (locked ?target))\n        (bent ?item))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (or \n        (and (unlocked ?target) (not (locked ?target)))\n        (and (not (bent ?item)) (straight ?item)))\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `hook` uses abstract parameters `?npc`, `?item`, and `?target` to adapt to a variety of tasks, making it applicable to multiple scenarios involving hooking-related tasks.\n2. **State Change**: Preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes, such as unlocking a car or straightening a hanger.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by combining similar effects into a single action, ensuring the merged action is simple and efficient.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. The use of the `or` operator allows for flexibility in the tasks performed by the action.\n\nBy following the guidelines, this merged action can handle various tasks while maintaining clarity and efficiency.",
    "Certainly! Let's create a merged PDDL action that encompasses the essence of the described actions under the universal action name \"straighten\". The goal is to abstract the concept of straightening or preparing an item for use, particularly in the context of manipulating objects to achieve a desired state. Here\u2019s how we can merge these actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action straighten ; Prepare an item for a specific task\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?target - target_entity)\n    :precondition (and \n        (has ?npc ?item)\n        (locked ?target)\n        (not (prepared ?npc ?item ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (prepared ?npc ?item ?target)\n        (not (has ?npc ?item))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"straighten\" to reflect the process of preparing or transforming an item for a specific task. \n   - It uses abstract parameters `?npc` (person), `?item` (object), and `?target` (target_entity), making the action applicable to various scenarios where an object needs to be prepared or manipulated.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - Preconditions ensure that the person has the item and the target is in a state (e.g., locked) that requires the item to be prepared.\n   - The effect of the action transforms the item into a \"prepared\" state and removes the item from the person\u2019s possession, indicating it's now in use or transformed.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The logic retains the essential steps: having an item, preparing it for use, and affecting the target\u2019s state, such as unlocking a car.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - The action merges the concepts of straightening the hanger and using it to unlock the car, focusing on the transition from having an item to preparing it for a task.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains consistency by clearly defining the precondition of needing the item and the effect of having it prepared for use, applicable in various contexts.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of preparing or transforming an item for a specific purpose, such as unlocking a car with a straightened hanger, while remaining applicable to other similar tasks.",
    "Sure, let's merge the provided `SlideCardIntoDoor` action sets into a single universal action that is applicable to various tasks involving sliding a card into a door lock.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action\n```pddl\n(:action SlideCardIntoDoor ; Slide a card into a door lock and update the state\n  :parameters (?u - user ?c - card ?l - lock)\n  :precondition (and\n    (atLocation ?u ?l)\n    (holds ?u ?c)\n    (isCard ?c)\n    (isLock ?l)\n    (doorLocked ?l)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (not (doorLocked ?l))\n    (doorUnlocked ?l)\n    (not (holds ?u ?c))\n    (cardInDoor ?c ?l)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name**: `SlideCardIntoDoor` - This name reflects the action of sliding the card into the door lock.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `?u` represents the user performing the action.\n  - `?c` represents the card being used.\n  - `?l` represents the lock on the door.\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - The user must be at the location of the lock (`atLocation ?u ?l`).\n  - The user must be holding the card (`holds ?u ?c`).\n  - The object being used must be a card (`isCard ?c`).\n  - The object being manipulated must be a lock (`isLock ?l`).\n  - The door must initially be locked (`doorLocked ?l`).\n- **Effects**:\n  - The door becomes unlocked (`doorUnlocked ?l`).\n  - The door is no longer locked (`not (doorLocked ?l)`).\n  - The user no longer holds the card (`not (holds ?u ?c)`).\n  - The card is now in the door (`cardInDoor ?c ?l`).\n\n### Guidelines Applied:\n- **Generality**: The use of abstract parameters (`?u`, `?c`, `?l`) allows this action to be adaptable to various scenarios where a card is used to unlock something.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state transformation, from the user holding a card and the door being locked, to the card being in the door and the door becoming unlocked.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing only on the essential state changes.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable."

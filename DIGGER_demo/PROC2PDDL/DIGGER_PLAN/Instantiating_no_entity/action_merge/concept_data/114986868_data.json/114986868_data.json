    "To create a merged \"make\" action that is adaptable to various tasks related to making or constructing objects in a jungle environment, I'll follow the guidelines provided. I'll focus on generality, capturing state changes, and ensuring logical consistency while avoiding redundancy. Here\u2019s the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?npc - entity ?item - object ?material - material ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_material ?npc ?material)\n                    (available ?npc)\n                    (at ?npc ?location)\n                    (suitable_location ?location)\n                    (not (constructed ?npc ?item))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (constructed ?npc ?item)\n              (not (has_material ?npc ?material))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action `make` is designed to be adaptable to a variety of tasks related to constructing or crafting an item. It uses abstract parameters like `?npc` for the entity performing the action, `?item` for the object being made, `?material` for the resources used, and `?location` for the place where the action occurs.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the NPC has the necessary material, is available, and is at a suitable location for making the item.\n   - The effects ensure that the item is constructed, and the material used is no longer available, reflecting a clear transformation of state.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Retains the core logic of checking if the material is available and that the item has not yet been constructed.\n   - The action results in the specified item being constructed, mirroring the effect of various specific actions like making a drill or building a shelter.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Combines similar actions into a single, efficient action by focusing on the commonalities in preconditions and effects across different tasks.\n   \n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains consistent logic, ensuring that it applies across different contexts without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis \"make\" action serves as a universal template for various crafting and construction tasks within the given context.\n",
    "To merge the given actions into a single, universal action named `collect`, which is adaptable to a variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states, we can follow the provided guidelines. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: collect\n```pddl\n(:action collect\n  ; Collect a resource and update the state of the entity involved\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - entity ?container - entity)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (in_location ?actor ?resource_location)\n                  (empty ?container))\n  :effect (and\n            (collected ?actor ?resource ?container)\n            (not (empty ?container)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:** The action `collect` uses abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?resource`, and `?container` to make it adaptable to various tasks. This avoids limiting it to specific types of actions and ensures it can be used in different contexts.\n   \n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects are designed to clearly reflect the state change. For example, the precondition checks that the `?actor` is in the correct location and that the `?container` is empty. The effect then updates the state to indicate that the resource has been collected and the container is no longer empty.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The action is simple and avoids unnecessary complexity by merging similar effects and ensuring that only essential preconditions and effects are included.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable. The action checks for the necessary conditions before performing the collection and updates the state appropriately.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged `collect` action can be applied to a variety of tasks involving collecting different types of resources, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "To merge the actions related to boiling and making things safe to drink, we will create a universal action named `boil` that generalizes the process of boiling and the preconditions required to achieve the goal state. Here is the merged action following the provided guidelines:\n\n### Action name after merge: boil\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n#### Action 1: Boil Water\n```pddl\n(:action boil_water\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?stream - stream ?fabric - fabric)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (collected_water ?npc)\n                    (fire_started ?jungle)\n                    (filtered ?npc ?fabric))\n    :effect (safe_to_drink ?npc)\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action boil\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?resource - resource ?tool - tool ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (collected ?entity ?resource)\n                    (fire_started ?location)\n                    (filtered ?entity ?tool))\n    :effect (safe_to_use ?entity ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?entity`, `?resource`, `?tool`, and `?location` to make the action widely applicable to various scenarios, beyond just water boiling.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions (`collected`, `fire_started`, `filtered`) clearly establish the necessary conditions for the action to occur, while the effect (`safe_to_use`) indicates the change in the state of the resource.\n3. **Simplicity**: By combining similar preconditions and effects, the merged action avoids redundancy and maintains simplicity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action retains logical coherence across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable in various contexts.\n\nThis merged action can now be adapted to a variety of tasks involving the collection, preparation, and making safe of resources, aligning with the core logic and requirements provided.",
    "Here is a merged action that combines the provided actions into a single, generalized framework, following the guidelines you specified:\n\n```pddl\n(:action get ; Retrieve a resource or achieve a state\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?resource - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?actor ?location)\n        (or \n            (and (has_tool ?actor ?resource) (location ?location riverside))\n            (not (achieved ?actor ?resource))\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (achieved ?actor ?resource)\n        (or \n            (lost ?actor)\n            (has_fish ?actor)\n            (resource_obtained ?actor)\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action uses abstract parameters `?actor`, `?resource`, and `?location` to apply to a wide range of scenarios. The parameter `?actor` can represent any entity, whether a person or an NPC, and `?resource` can be any object or state that the actor is trying to achieve or obtain.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition requires the actor to be at a specific location. Additional preconditions include possessing a tool if catching fish at a riverside, or simply not having achieved the desired state yet.\n   - The effect indicates that the actor has now achieved the desired state, whether that means catching fish, getting lost, or obtaining some other resource.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action eliminates redundancy by combining similar effects, such as achieving a state or obtaining a resource, into a single effect condition. This ensures that the action remains straightforward and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain logical consistency across different contexts. The merged action can be adapted to various tasks, such as catching fish or getting lost, by adjusting the parameters and the specific preconditions/effects applicable to the task at hand.",
    "To merge the provided PDDL actions into a single universal action that adheres to the guidelines, we need to ensure that the resulting action is general, captures the state change accurately, is simple, and logically consistent. Let\u2019s proceed with the merging process:\n\n### Merged Action\n**Action name after merge:** cover\n\n**Action sets that need to be merged:**\n1. **cover_shelter**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action cover_shelter\n       :parameters (?n - npc ?c - camp ?s - shelter)\n       :precondition (and\n                       (at ?n ?c)\n                       (shelter_built ?c)\n                       (not (shelter_covered ?s))\n                     )\n       :effect (shelter_covered ?s)\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action Specification\n```pddl\n(:action cover ; Cover a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?location - place ?resource - item)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?actor ?location)\n                    (prepared ?location)\n                    (not (covered ?resource))\n                  )\n    :effect (covered ?resource)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generality**:\n   - Parameters have been generalized from `?n - npc`, `?c - camp`, and `?s - shelter` to `?actor - entity`, `?location - place`, and `?resource - item`. This increases applicability to a variety of tasks involving covering or preparing resources.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions (`at ?actor ?location`, `prepared ?location`, `not (covered ?resource)`) and effects (`covered ?resource`) clearly reflect the change in state, ensuring the task progresses towards the goal state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is simple and efficient, avoiding redundancy by capturing the core logic of the preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring that the action can be applied to a variety of scenarios involving covering or preparing resources.\n\nBy following the guidelines and ensuring the resulting action is both general and specific to the state changes required, we have created a merged action that encompasses the intent and logic of the provided tasks. This merged action can be adapted to various tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states in a straightforward and efficient manner."

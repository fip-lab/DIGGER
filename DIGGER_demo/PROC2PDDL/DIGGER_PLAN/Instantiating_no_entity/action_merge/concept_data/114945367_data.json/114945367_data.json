    "Given the provided actions, the merged action should be able to handle the gathering of different types of resources while maintaining simplicity, avoiding redundancy, and ensuring logical consistency. The merged action for the task \"gather\" can be designed as follows:\n\n### Merged Action: gather\n\n```lisp\n(:action gather ; Gather various resources and update their status\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - resource ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?npc ?location)\n    (or (and (not (gathered ?item)) (resource_type ?item branch))\n        (and (not (collected ?item)) (resource_type ?item tinder))\n        (and (not (collected ?item)) (resource_type ?item kindling))\n        (and (found_water_source ?location) (not (has_water ?npc)) (resource_type ?item water)))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (or (gathered ?item) (collected ?item))\n    (when (resource_type ?item water) (has_water ?npc))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - `?npc` - The agent performing the action.\n   - `?item` - The resource to be gathered.\n   - `?location` - The place where the resource is gathered.\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - The agent must be at the location.\n   - The resource must not already be gathered or collected.\n   - For branches, the item should not be gathered.\n   - For tinder and kindling, the item should not be collected.\n   - For water, the water source at the location must be found, and the agent must not already have water.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - The resource is marked as gathered or collected.\n   - If the resource is water, the agent also gets water.\n\n### Core Logic:\n- The action is abstract and can handle multiple resource types by checking the type of the resource and its respective preconditions and effects.\n- The action avoids redundancy by merging similar conditions and effects.\n- The logical consistency is maintained by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable for different types of resources.",
    "To merge the given actions (`prop_up_branches` and `form_shelter_structure`) into a single universal action called `prop`, we will follow the guidelines provided:\n\n**Generality**: We will use abstract parameters to ensure the action can apply to various tasks beyond just the specific examples provided.\n\n**State Change**: The preconditions and effects will clearly define the changes in state.\n\n**Simplicity**: We will avoid redundancy by merging similar effects and keeping the action simple.\n\n**Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects will remain consistent and reasonable.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action prop ; Prop an entity and update structure status\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?structure - structure)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (gathered ?entity)\n                  (not (propped_up ?entity ?structure))\n                )\n  :effect (propped_up ?entity ?structure)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?entity` and `?structure` are abstract enough to adapt to various tasks involving propping or supporting entities within a structure.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the entity has been gathered and has not yet been propped up. The effect marks the entity as propped up within the structure.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by focusing on the core logic of propping up an entity and updating the structure status.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logical and consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied to different contexts where entities need to be supported within a structure.\n\nThis merged action `prop` is now a universal action that can be used in various scenarios where an entity needs to be propped up within a structure, meeting the requirements of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "Based on the given guidelines and the provided actions, the merged action for the tasks related to building should encompass forming a shelter structure, building a shelter, building a teepee, starting a fire, and cooking. The merged action will be general, adaptable, and capable of transforming the state progressively. Here is the merged action:\n\n**Action name after merge: build**\n\n**Merged Action:**\n```pddl\n(:action build\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?location - place ?structure - object ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (available ?actor)\n                    (not (built ?location ?structure))\n                    (or (searched ?location)\n                        (forall (?part - part) (propped_up ?part ?resource)))\n                    (or (not (shelter_built ?location))\n                        (fire_started ?location))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (built ?location ?structure)\n              (or (shelter_formed ?resource)\n                  (shelter_built ?location)\n                  (built_teepee ?structure)\n                  (cooked_meal ?actor))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action `build` uses abstract parameters such as `?actor`, `?location`, `?structure`, and `?resource` to ensure it is adaptable to various tasks.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly denote the state changes. The precondition checks for the actor's availability and whether the structure at the location is not built. It also checks if the area is searched or if parts are propped up for forming a shelter. The effect progressively updates the state to show that the structure is built, a shelter is formed, a teepee is built, or a meal is cooked.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects and ensuring that the core logic is retained.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts. The action is designed to be flexible and applicable to multiple tasks while ensuring clarity and reasonableness.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action while adhering to the guidelines, we can define a generalized action named `search`. This action will encapsulate the logic of searching for different resources or information across various contexts. Below is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action search ; Generalized search action to find and update the status of a resource or area\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?target - object)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?actor ?target) ; The actor must be present at the target location or associated with the target\n    (not (found ?target)) ; The target must not have been found or explored yet\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (found ?target) ; Updates the status to indicate the target has been found or explored\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?actor` and `?target` to represent any agent and object, respectively. This allows the action to be used in multiple contexts, such as searching for water sources, exploring areas, or any other similar task.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly define the state change. The precondition `(not (found ?target))` ensures the target has not been explored yet, and the effect `(found ?target)` updates the state to indicate the target has been successfully searched.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: Retains the core logic of requiring an agent's presence at the location (`at ?actor ?target`) before performing the search, which is consistent across different tasks.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By using the `found` predicate, we avoid redundancy and unify the effects of the actions, simplifying the logic and making it applicable to multiple tasks without unnecessary complexity.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Maintains logical consistency by ensuring preconditions and effects are reasonable and adaptable to different scenarios, such as searching for resources or exploring new areas.\n\nThis merged action should effectively capture the essence of both provided actions while remaining adaptable to a wide range of tasks involving searching or exploring.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action, we'll follow the guidelines to ensure generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. The merged action should encapsulate the core logic of starting a process, while being adaptable to various contexts involving resource checking, modification, or creation.\n\nLet's merge the given actions:\n\n1. **start_fire**: Starting a fire requires certain resources to be collected and a structure to be built before the fire can be started.\n2. **cook_using_campfire**: This action might involve using the started fire for cooking, which would require the fire to be already started.\n\nMerged Action: `start`\n\n```lisp\n(:action start\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?process - process ?resource1 - resource ?resource2 - resource ?resource3 - resource)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (available ?actor)\n                  (collected ?resource1)\n                  (collected ?resource2)\n                  (built ?resource3)\n                  (not (process_started ?process))\n                )\n  :effect (process_started ?process)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action `start` is designed to be general and adaptable to various tasks, with abstract parameters `?actor`, `?process`, `?resource1`, `?resource2`, and `?resource3`.\n   - This action can represent starting a fire, cooking using the campfire, or initiating any process requiring some resources and a structure.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that necessary resources (`?resource1`, `?resource2`) are collected and a structure (`?resource3`) is built before starting the process (`?process`).\n   - The effect updates the state to indicate that the process has started (`process_started ?process`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient by focusing on essential preconditions and effects.\n   - Unnecessary complexity is removed to maintain clarity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and reasonable across different contexts.\n   - The requirement that the actor must be available and the resources must be collected and built ensures that the action is feasible and meaningful.\n\nThis merged action `start` can now be applied to various tasks involving initiating processes with required resources and structures, while maintaining clarity and efficiency."

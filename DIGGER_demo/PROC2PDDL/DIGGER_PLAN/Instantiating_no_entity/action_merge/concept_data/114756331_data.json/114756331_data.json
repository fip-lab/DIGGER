    "Here is the merged action for the given examples:\n\n```lisp\n(:action free ; Free an entity from a constraint and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - entity ?constraint - constraint)\n  :precondition (and (constrained ?entity ?constraint) (capable ?entity) (not (free ?entity ?constraint)))\n  :effect (and (free ?entity ?constraint) (not (constrained ?entity ?constraint)))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity` and `?constraint`), making the action adaptable to a variety of tasks involving freeing an entity from some constraint.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transition from a constrained state to a free state.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by merging similar constraints and focusing on the core logic of freeing an entity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic with clear preconditions and effects, applicable across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be applied to various scenarios where an entity needs to be freed from some form of constraint, ensuring adaptability, clarity, and efficiency.",
    "To merge the actions for the \"stay\" task, we need to create a universal action that captures the essence of staying safe and ensuring stability in a potentially hazardous situation like quicksand. Here's how we can merge the actions while adhering to the guidelines:\n\n```pddl\n(:action stay_safe\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?tool - tool ?hazardous_area - area)\n    :precondition (and (inArea ?npc ?hazardous_area) (calm ?npc) (hasTool ?npc ?tool))\n    :effect (and (onFirmGround ?npc) (not (inArea ?npc ?hazardous_area)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"stay_safe\" to reflect the general idea of maintaining stability and safety in any hazardous area, not just quicksand.\n   - Parameters are abstract (`?npc`, `?tool`, `?hazardous_area`) to allow flexibility across different scenarios.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition requires the NPC to be in the hazardous area, calm, and in possession of a tool, which reflects the requirements across the original actions.\n   - The effect ensures that the NPC reaches firm ground and is no longer in the hazardous area, capturing the progression from being in danger to reaching safety.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action removes redundant conditions and effects by combining the logic of staying buoyant and using a tool into a single action.\n   - By focusing on the essential state changes (from in danger to safe), it avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent with the need to ensure safety in a potentially dangerous environment.\n   - This action maintains coherence by requiring the NPC to be calm and equipped with a tool, which aligns with the logic of the merged actions.\n\nThis merged action \"stay_safe\" should be adaptable to various tasks involving maintaining safety in hazardous environments, ensuring it meets the objectives of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",
    "(:action identify ; Identify a resource and update its status\n :parameters (?entity - object ?location - location)\n :precondition (and (at ?entity ?location) (not (identified ?entity)))\n :effect (and (identified ?entity) (not (unidentified ?entity)))\n)\n\nExplanation:\n\nGenerality: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?entity - object and ?location - location) to increase applicability across various tasks, not just limited to identifying quicksand.\n\nState Change: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change, transforming the entity's state from unidentified to identified.\n\nSimplicity: The action is simple and avoids redundancy by using a single set of parameters and effects.\n\nLogical Consistency: The action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable in different contexts.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action named \"mark,\" we need to ensure the parameters are abstract and applicable to various tasks. The preconditions and effects should clearly describe the state changes, and the actions should be general yet retain their core logic without redundancy or unnecessary complexity.\n\nHere's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action mark ; Mark an entity and update its status\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity - entity ?marker - marker)\n  :precondition (and (identified ?entity) (at ?marker ?entity) (not (marked ?entity)))\n  :effect (and (marked ?entity) (visible ?marker) (not (unmarked ?entity)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstract: `?agent` can be any agent, `?entity` can be any entity to be marked, and `?marker` can be any marking object.\n   - This action can adapt to various tasks involving marking different entities with different markers.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the entity is identified and the marker is at the entity's location.\n   - The effects reflect the change in state: the entity becomes marked, the marker becomes visible, and the entity is no longer unmarked.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is kept concise and efficient by focusing on the essential preconditions and effects without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain clear and reasonable logic across different contexts, ensuring consistent behavior for marking various entities.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action \"mark\" is adaptable, efficient, and logically consistent for a variety of tasks involving marking and updating the status of entities.",
    "Here's the merged action for the given tasks:\n\nAction name after merge: create\n\n```pddl\n(:action create ; Create a new state or transform an existing entity\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?attribute - attribute)\n  :precondition (and (identified ?entity) (not (has_attribute ?entity ?attribute)))\n  :effect (and (has_attribute ?entity ?attribute) (created ?entity))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?attribute` to adapt to multiple tasks, avoiding specificity to a particular type of action.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state, ensuring that the entity is identified and does not initially have the specified attribute. Once the action is performed, the entity gains the attribute, and it is marked as created.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single, efficient action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent logic, ensuring clarity and reasonableness across different contexts.",
    "To create a merged action named \"inform\" that incorporates the essence of various tasks involving informing others and updating their state, we can follow the guidelines provided. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action inform ;  Inform an entity about a resource and update their awareness status\n  :parameters (?entity - agent ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (identified ?resource) (marked ?resource) (safe ?entity) (not (informed ?entity)))\n  :effect (and (informed ?entity) (aware ?entity ?resource))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters `?entity` and `?resource` are abstract enough to apply to various scenarios involving different entities and resources.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly convey the change in state. For example, an entity (?entity) becomes informed about a resource (?resource) and their awareness status is updated.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action is concise and avoids redundancy by using general terms and combining similar effects.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring that the action is reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action \"inform\" captures the core logic of informing an entity about a resource and updating their state accordingly, making it adaptable to a variety of tasks."

    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"gather,\" we will follow the guidelines to ensure generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the merged action based on the provided guidelines and action sets:\n\n**Merged Action:**\n\n```pddl\n(:action gather\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (at ?entity ?location) (available ?entity))\n  :effect (and (gathered ?entity) (not (at ?entity ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Generality:** The action is named \"gather\" and uses abstract parameters `?entity` (object) and `?location` (place) to make it adaptable to various tasks. This allows it to represent gathering any type of resource or item from any location.\n   \n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change:\n   - **Preconditions:** The entity must be at the specified location and available.\n   - **Effects:** The entity is now considered gathered, and it is no longer at the original location.\n\n3. **Core Logic:** The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity:\n   - Preconditions check the presence and availability of the entity.\n   - Effects update the gathered status and remove the entity from its initial location.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:** Similar effects are merged efficiently. For instance, \"gathered,\" \"retrieved,\" and \"obtained\" are unified under \"gathered,\" simplifying the action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts. It ensures that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, regardless of the specific task.\n\nWith this merged action, you can adapt it to various scenarios involving gathering resources or items, ensuring simplicity and efficiency in your PDDL descriptions.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action called \"collect,\" we need to ensure that the merged action is abstract enough to apply to various tasks while maintaining clear preconditions and effects that reflect state changes. Let's merge the given actions into one:\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n\n1. **Collect nails**\n```pddl\n(:action collect_nails\n    :parameters (?n - nails ?t - toolbox)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?n ?t)\n      (available ?n)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (collected ?n)\n      (not (at ?n ?t))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n2. **Retrieve paint from the supply room**\n```pddl\n(:action retrieve_paint\n    :parameters (?p - paint ?r - supply_room)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?p ?r)\n      (available ?p)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (collected ?p)\n      (not (at ?p ?r))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action collect ; Collect an item from a location and update its state\n    :parameters (?item - object ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?item ?loc)\n      (available ?item)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (collected ?item)\n      (not (at ?item ?loc))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters `?item - object` and `?loc - location` to increase its applicability to various tasks beyond just nails and paint.\n2. **State Change**: The action's preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state, where the item is collected from a location and is no longer available at that location.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects of collecting items and ensures simplicity and efficiency.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the action is clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action \"collect\" can now be used for various tasks involving collecting or retrieving items from different locations.",
    "The merged action `make` should encapsulate the process of creating or transforming an entity, in this case, making paper from papyrus. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n### Merged Action: make\n\n```lisp\n(:action make ; Create or transform an entity\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (obtained ?item) (at ?npc ?location) (not (made ?item)))\n  :effect (made ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Generality**: The merged action `make` is designed to be general and adaptable to various tasks involving creation or transformation. It uses abstract parameters (`?npc`, `?item`, and `?location`) to increase its applicability.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. The entity (`?item`) must be obtained and the character (`?npc`) must be at a specific location (`?location`). The effect is that the item is marked as made.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simplified to avoid redundancy, focusing on the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action can now be used to represent various tasks that involve creating or transforming entities, not limited to making paper from papyrus but adaptable to other similar processes."

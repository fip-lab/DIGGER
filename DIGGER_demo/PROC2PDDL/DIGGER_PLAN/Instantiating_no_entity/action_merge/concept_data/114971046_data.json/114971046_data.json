    "Here's the merged action for \"stay\" based on the provided action sets:\n\n```pddl\n(:action stay\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?location - place ?resource - object)\n    :precondition (and (available ?npc) (in ?npc ?location) (stocked ?npc ?resource))\n    :effect (and (sheltered ?npc) (not (exposed ?npc)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation**: This merged action \"stay\" is designed to be general and adaptable to various tasks that involve an NPC staying in a specific location with necessary resources. The precondition ensures that the NPC is available, is in the specified location, and has the necessary resources stocked. The effect indicates that the NPC is now sheltered and no longer exposed to outside conditions. This action maintains simplicity and logical consistency, ensuring that the preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. It avoids redundancy and captures the core logic of the original actions.",
    "To create a merged PDDL action named `get` from the given action sets, we will follow the provided guidelines to ensure generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is how the merged action might look:\n\n### Original Actions\n\n1. **get_food**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action get_food\n       :parameters (?npc - agent ?food - item)\n       :precondition (and (non_perishable ?food) (inStorage ?food) (available ?npc))\n       :effect (and (stocked ?npc ?food) (not (inStorage ?food)))\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Merged Action\n\nTo merge this action with other similar actions, we need to generalize the parameters and combine similar logic while ensuring the merged action is adaptable to various tasks:\n\n```lisp\n(:action get\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object)\n    :precondition (and (inStorage ?resource) (available ?actor))\n    :effect (and (obtained ?actor ?resource) (not (inStorage ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: We use abstract parameters `?actor` and `?resource` instead of specific terms like `?npc` and `?food` to make the action applicable to a wide range of tasks involving resource acquisition.\n  \n- **State Change**: The precondition checks if the resource is available in storage and if the actor is available to perform the task. The effect indicates that the actor has obtained the resource, and it is no longer in storage.\n  \n- **Simplicity**: The action is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity by focusing on the essential logic of acquiring a resource.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action can be applied in various contexts without ambiguity.\n\nThis merged `get` action can serve as a template for tasks where an agent needs to acquire any resource from a storage-like state, ensuring both flexibility and clarity in defining PDDL actions."

    "Here is the merged action for the \"drink\" task, following the guidelines provided:\n\n```pddl\n(:action drink ; Consume a liquid to achieve a desired state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?liquid - liquid)\n  :precondition (and \n                 (at ?p ?liquid)\n                 (consumable ?liquid)\n                 (not (spoiled ?liquid)))\n  :effect (and \n           (hydrated ?p)\n           (not (at ?p ?liquid))\n           (consumed ?liquid))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters `?p` for person and `?liquid` for liquid, which allows it to be applicable to a variety of drinking tasks beyond just drinking water. The parameter `?liquid` is abstract enough to include any type of consumable liquid.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The precondition ensures that the person is at the location of the liquid and that the liquid is consumable and not spoiled. The effects indicate that the person becomes hydrated and the liquid is consumed, reflecting the state change.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy by combining checks for any consumable liquid rather than just specifying water, and it keeps the conditions simple and directly related to the task of drinking.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent for a drinking action, where the person needs to be at the location of the liquid, and the liquid needs to be safe to consume. The effects logically follow from these conditions.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"carve,\" we need to abstract the parameters, consolidate similar preconditions, and combine the effects while ensuring logical consistency. Here's how the merged \"carve\" action could look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action carve ; Carve a material using a tool and update the material's state\n  :parameters (?p - person ?m - material ?t - tool)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (has_tool ?p ?t)\n                  (has_material ?p ?m)\n                  (not (carved ?m))\n                  (material_intact ?m)\n                 )\n  :effect (and\n            (carved ?m)\n            (material_condition ?m grooved)\n            (not (has_material ?p ?m))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action is designed to be applicable to various carving tasks by using abstract parameters (`?p`, `?m`, and `?t`), representing a person, material, and tool, respectively.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the person has the necessary tool and material, and the material is intact and not yet carved. The effects describe the state change: the material becomes carved, its condition changes to \"grooved,\" and the person no longer has the material.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: By merging the actions, we avoid redundancy and simplify the logic, focusing on the essential preconditions and effects.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that all necessary conditions are met before carving and that the effects reflect a logical transformation of the material's state.\n\nThis merged \"carve\" action can be adapted to different contexts involving carving tasks, such as woodworking or primitive tool-making, by substituting specific instances for the abstract parameters.",
    "To create a universal \"hunt\" action that merges the given actions while ensuring generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract the parameters and state changes to cover all tasks related to hunting, checking, and preparing resources. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action hunt\n  :parameters (?p - person ?r - resource ?l - location)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?p ?l)\n                  (available ?r ?l)\n                  (not (obtained ?p ?r)))\n  :effect (and\n            (obtained ?p ?r)\n            (not (available ?r ?l))\n            (checked ?r)\n            (clean ?r)\n            (prepared ?r ?p ?l))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstracted to a person (?p), a resource (?r), and a location (?l), making the action adaptable to various tasks like hunting, checking, and preparing.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the person is at a specific location and the resource is available there.\n   - Effects include obtaining the resource, marking it as checked and clean, and preparing it for further use.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action combines obtaining, checking, cleaning, and preparing resources into a single, simplified action to avoid redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency by ensuring that the resource is only marked as obtained, checked, and clean if these conditions are met.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged \"hunt\" action captures the essence of the original actions while being applicable to a wide range of tasks, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "To merge the given actions into a universal \"prepare\" action that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract the parameters and combine similar preconditions and effects. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action prepare ; Prepare an item using a tool and resources\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?item - object ?tool - tool ?resource - resource ?container - container)\n  :precondition (and\n    (available ?agent)\n    (at ?item ?agent)\n    (at ?tool ?agent)\n    (at ?item ?container)\n    (at ?resource ?container)\n    (not (prepared ?item))\n    (not (cooked ?item))\n    (or (caught ?item) (prepared ?item))\n    (or (heated ?resource) (prepared ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (prepared ?item)\n    (cooked ?item)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to apply to a variety of tasks. For example, `?item` can be any object being prepared, and `?tool`, `?resource`, `?container` are general enough to fit different scenarios.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action reflects a transformation process: an item is first prepared, then cooked. Preconditions ensure the item is in the correct state and location before these transformations.\n   \n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant conditions are removed. The `prepare` and `cook` processes are combined under the assumption that prepared items can also be cooked, reflecting a continuous transformation.\n   \n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logical and applicable to the task of preparing an item, ensuring the action is correct in various contexts. The use of `or` in preconditions allows for multiple valid initial states, such as an item being caught or prepared, and a resource being heated or simply a requirement for preparation.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of preparation while being flexible in its application, ensuring it can be adapted to different tasks involving preparing and cooking, as per the original action descriptions.",
    "Given the provided actions and the guidelines, we will combine the actions to create a universal \"heat\" action that can be applied to various tasks involving heating a resource and using it for a subsequent task. The merged action will be abstract, capturing the essence of heating and cooking.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action heat\n  ; Heat a resource and update its status\n  :parameters (?resource - resource ?source - source ?task - task)\n  :precondition (and \n    (at ?resource ?source)\n    (not (heated ?resource))\n    (task_requires_heating ?task ?resource)\n    (not (task_completed ?task))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (heated ?resource)\n    (task_completed ?task)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to `?resource`, `?source`, and `?task` to apply to various heating tasks, not limited to water or fish.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions check if the resource is at the source, if it is not already heated, and if a task requires the heating of the resource. Upon completion, the resource is marked as heated, and the task is marked as completed.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained to ensure that the heating action reflects a clear state change.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By merging similar effects (heating the resource and completing the task), the action remains simple and efficient.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring clear and reasonable transitions between states.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible and abstract way to represent heating tasks across different contexts.",

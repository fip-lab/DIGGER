    "Let's generate the PDDL actions for the task \"eat_fish\" based on the provided steps and descriptions.\n\nTask: eat_fish\nFile Name: eat_fish_domain.pddl\n\nSteps:\n1. collect_rain_water npc rainforest\n2. create_fire npc jungle\n3. make_spear npc spear wood\n4. make_drill npc wood drill\n5. catch_fish npc spear riverside\n\nDescriptions:\n- If you don\u2019t have a water bottle or other container to collect water, try to find other natural containers in the jungle such as a coconut shell or piece of wood shaped like a bowl. You can also leave these items out when it rains to collect the fresh water.\n- Boil water from streams to kill any bacteria. Look for running streams to find fresh water. Filter out any particles through a sock, shirt, or other fabric, then start a fire and boil the water to kill bacteria that can make you sick.\n- Make a 4-pronged bamboo spear to fish with. Find a 6-ft (1.8 m) stalk of bamboo and cut 4- 6 in (15.24 cm) slits into 1 end of it with a knife or sharp rock. Weave a piece of vine into the slits to separate the tip of the bamboo into 4 prongs and sharpen them with a knife or a sharp rock.\n- The plastic sheet will accumulate condensation that will drip down the underside of the sheet and into the container. This water is distilled and safe to drink.\n- Build simple hole-in-the-ground traps to catch animals. Dig a hole in the ground and cover it with something like a large leaf. Put a piece of fruit in the middle as bait. When an animal comes to take the fruit, they will fall in the hole and you can kill it, skin it, and cook it to eat it.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action collect_rain_water\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?container - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (container_empty ?container) (location ?location rainforest))\n    :effect (and (container_full ?container) (has_water ?npc))\n)\n\n(:action create_fire\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?fire_source - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (has_fire_source ?npc ?fire_source) (location ?location jungle))\n    :effect (and (fire_created ?location) (can_boil_water ?npc))\n)\n\n(:action make_spear\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?spear - object ?wood - material)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (has_material ?npc ?wood) (location ?location jungle))\n    :effect (and (has_spear ?npc ?spear))\n)\n\n(:action make_drill\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?drill - object ?wood - material)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (has_material ?npc ?wood) (location ?location jungle))\n    :effect (and (has_drill ?npc ?drill))\n)\n\n(:action catch_fish\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?spear - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (has_spear ?npc ?spear) (location ?location riverside))\n    :effect (and (has_fish ?npc) (fish_caught ?npc))\n)\n```\n\nEach action specifies the parameters, preconditions, and effects based on the provided steps and descriptions.

The precondition is that the NPC has wood and does not already have a drill. The effect is that the NPC now has a drill and no longer has the wood.\n- **collect_rain_water**: This action involves collecting rainwater in the rainforest. The precondition is that the NPC is in the rainforest and has an empty container. The effect is that the NPC has collected water in the container, making it no longer empty.\n- **create_fire**: This action involves creating a fire in the jungle. The precondition is that the NPC is in the jungle, has a drill, and has wood. The effect is that a fire is created, and the NPC no longer has the wood or the drill.\n\nThese actions are tailored to the task of making a fire and collecting water, based on the provided steps and descriptions."

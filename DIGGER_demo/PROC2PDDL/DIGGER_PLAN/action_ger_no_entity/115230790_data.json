    "Sure, here is the PDDL actions based on the provided task and steps:\n\nTask: listen_to_astronomers_predictions_and_move\n\nSteps:\n- move_away npc philly salt_lake bunker2\n- listen_to_astronomers npc home\n\nDescriptions:\n- Move away from coastal areas. Because the earth is made up of 71% water, there\u2019s a greater likelihood that the comet will hit a body of water. If this does happen, it could mean that giant tsunamis would be created by the initial impact and they would likely destroy our coastal cities. Additionally, there would be an increase in water vapor entering our atmosphere which would cause heavy rain, which could cause landslides and flooding.\n- Pay attention to astronomers\u2019 predictions on any possible collisions with earth. NASA currently has astronomers that track comets that are flying in our solar system. As a result, there\u2019s a very good chance they will know if there is a large object about to collide with us. By listening to their predictions, you can develop a real sense of how much time you have to prepare.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Move away from coastal areas\n(:action move_away\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?from - location ?to - location ?safe - bunker)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (at ?npc ?from)\n                  (coastal ?from)\n                  (safe_location ?to)\n                  (bunker ?safe))\n  :effect (and\n            (at ?npc ?to)\n            (not (at ?npc ?from))\n            (safe ?npc ?safe)\n           )\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Listen to astronomers\n(:action listen_to_astronomers\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?loc - location)\n  :precondition (at ?npc ?loc)\n  :effect (informed ?npc)\n)\n```\n\nExplanation of the PDDL actions:\n\n1. **move_away**:\n    - **Parameters**: `?npc` (the person moving), `?from` (current location), `?to` (new location), and `?safe` (safe bunker).\n    - **Preconditions**: The person is at a coastal location, and the new location is a safe place and has a bunker.\n    - **Effects**: The person moves to the new location and is marked as safe in the bunker.\n\n2. **listen_to_astronomers**:\n    - **Parameters**: `?npc` (the person listening), `?loc` (location of the person).\n    - **Preconditions**: The person is at the specified location.\n    - **Effects**: The person becomes informed by listening to the astronomers.\n\nThese actions encapsulate the steps of moving away from a coastal area to a safer inland location and listening to astronomers' predictions to stay informed.",
    "Sure, I can help with that. Here are the PDDL actions for the given task and steps:\n\nTask: final\n\nSteps:\n- check_supplies food npc\n- wait it out until you hear unified reports\n- outfit_bunker_with_energy_source bunker2 npc heat\n- stay_in_isolation bunker2 npc\n- buy_weapons npc weapon\n- buy_supplies food npc market\n- listen_to_astronomers npc home\n- check_bunker bunker2 npc\n- move_away npc philly salt_lake bunker2\n- check_weapons pistol ammunition\n\nDescriptions:\n- Make sure to stock your hide-out with canned food, dried goods, non-perishable foods, and bottled water.\n- Don\u2019t believe everything you hear. Early reporting is notoriously inaccurate at times, so wait it out until you hear unified reports.\n- Move into a bunker or fortified structure and outfit it with an energy source. An underground bunker isn\u2019t only the best for the time of impact; it will also protect you from environmental hazards after the comet has hit. When the comet hits, dust, soot, and water will shoot up into our atmosphere, making it cold for months to years.\n- Isolation has multiple negative effects on your mental health, so having people with you is a good idea if you want to stay mentally healthy.\n- Buy weapons and ammunition for after the impact. You may be more concerned with withstanding the destruction of the comet impact itself, but you also need to be conscious of the possible dangers of other people after the dust settles.\n- Purchase enough food, water, medicine, and other supplies. If the comet does hit on land, dust and rock particles flying into our atmosphere will make it too dangerous to go outside for months to years.\n- Pay attention to astronomers\u2019 predictions on any possible collisions with earth. NASA currently has astronomers that track comets that are flying in our solar system. As a result, there\u2019s a very good chance they will know if there is a large object about to collide with us. By listening to their predictions, you can develop a real sense of how much time you have to prepare.\n- Limit your generator usage and only use it if necessary. Your generator will be a lifesaver for many things while you are in your bunker. You can use it to produce heat, cook food, and power lights. However, because most generators run on fuel, it\u2019s important that you limit its usage because you will likely have a limited amount of fuel in your bunker. If you aren't in a bunker, a generator may still work, but there's a good chance that the main power grid will be down.\n- Move away from coastal areas. Because the earth is made up of 71% water, there\u2019s a greater likelihood that the comet will hit a body of water. If this does happen, it could mean that giant tsunamis would be created by the initial impact and they would likely destroy our coastal cities. Additionally, there would be an increase in water vapor entering our atmosphere which would cause heavy rain, which could cause landslides and flooding.\n- A semi-automatic rifle and a pistol with enough ammunition should be more than enough firepower.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```lisp\n(:action check_supplies\n    :parameters (?food - food ?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (stocked ?food)\n                    (informed ?npc))\n    :effect (checked ?food)\n)\n\n(:action wait_for_reports\n    :parameters (?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (early_reports ?npc))\n    :effect (and\n              (unified_reports ?npc)\n              (not (early_reports ?npc)))\n)\n\n(:action outfit_bunker_with_energy_source\n    :parameters (?bunker - bunker ?npc - npc ?heat - heat)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (in_bunker ?npc ?bunker)\n                    (has_energy_source ?npc))\n    :effect (and\n              (outfitted ?bunker ?heat)\n              (prepared ?bunker))\n)\n\n(:action stay_in_isolation\n    :parameters (?bunker - bunker ?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (in_bunker ?npc ?bunker)\n    :effect (isolated ?npc)\n)\n\n(:action buy_weapons\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?weapon - weapon)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (needs_weapon ?npc)\n                    (available ?weapon))\n    :effect (has_weapon ?npc ?weapon)\n)\n\n(:action buy_supplies\n    :parameters (?food - food ?npc - npc ?market - market)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (needs_supplies ?npc)\n                    (available ?food ?market))\n    :effect (has_supplies ?npc ?food)\n)\n\n(:action listen_to_astronomers\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?home - home)\n    :precondition (at_home ?npc ?home)\n    :effect (informed ?npc)\n)\n\n(:action check_bunker\n    :parameters (?bunker - bunker ?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_bunker ?npc ?bunker)\n                    (prepared ?bunker))\n    :effect (checked ?bunker)\n)\n\n(:action move_away\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?from - location ?to - location ?bunker - bunker)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at_location ?npc ?from)\n                    (safe ?to))\n    :effect (and\n              (at_location ?npc ?to)\n              (in_bunker ?npc ?bunker))\n)\n\n(:action check_weapons\n    :parameters (?pistol - weapon ?ammunition - ammunition)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_weapon ?npc ?pistol)\n                    (has_ammunition ?npc ?ammunition))\n    :effect (checked ?pistol)\n)\n```\n\nThese actions should capture the intent and logic of each step described for the task."

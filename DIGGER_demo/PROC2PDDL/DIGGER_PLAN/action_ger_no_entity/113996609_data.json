    "Sure, I'll generate the PDDL actions based on the provided task and steps. \n\nTask: clean_water\n\nSteps:\nStep 1: drink_water person water\nStep 2: carve_groove person wood rock\nStep 3: check_water npc river water\n\nDescriptions:\n- Do not drink salt water from the ocean because it will dehydrate you.\n- Hunt for fish, insects, and small animals for food. The protein and nutrients from meat and fish will give you energy. Mollusks, clams, oysters, crabs, muscles, and fish are all things that you may be able to find in the shallow waters surrounding or on an island.\n- Check for water at the base of leaves or cacti, inside of caves, hollowed trees, or undercut banks.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action drink_water\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - water)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?p ?w)\n                    (not (salt_water ?w))\n                    (clean ?w))\n    :effect (and\n              (hydrated ?p)\n              (not (at ?p ?w))\n             )\n  )\n\n(:action carve_groove\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - wood ?r - rock)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?p ?w)\n                    (at ?p ?r)\n                    (sharp ?r))\n    :effect (and\n              (groove_carved ?w)\n              (not (sharp ?r))\n             )\n  )\n\n(:action check_water\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?r - river ?w - water)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?n ?r)\n                    (source_of ?r ?w))\n    :effect (and\n              (checked ?w)\n              (clean ?w)\n             )\n  )\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **drink_water**: This action ensures that the person drinks only clean water and not salt water. It hydrates the person and removes the person from the water source.\n- **carve_groove**: This action involves the person carving a groove in the wood using a rock. The rock must be sharp, and the action results in the wood having a groove and the rock losing its sharpness.\n- **check_water**: This action involves an NPC checking the water in the river. The water must be sourced from the river, and the action results in the water being marked as checked and clean.",

    "To generate the PDDL actions for the task \"start_fire\" with the step \"carve_groove person wood rock,\" we need to ensure that the action is relevant to the task of starting a fire. The task involves using a rock to carve a groove into a piece of wood, which can be a step towards creating friction to ignite a fire. Here's how you can structure the PDDL actions:\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action to carve a groove in the wood using a rock\n(:action carve-groove\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - wood ?r - rock)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (person_has ?p ?r)\n                    (wood_intact ?w)\n                    (not (groove_carved ?w))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (groove_carved ?w)\n              (wood_condition ?w grooved)\n            )\n  )\n\n;; Action to start a fire using grooved wood and a friction tool (e.g., stick)\n(:action start-fire\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - wood ?f - friction_tool)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (groove_carved ?w)\n                    (person_has ?p ?f)\n                    (wood_condition ?w grooved)\n                    (not (fire_started))\n                   )\n    :effect (and\n              (fire_started)\n              (wood_condition ?w used_for_fire)\n            )\n  )\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Action: carve-groove**\n   - **Parameters**: `?p` (person), `?w` (wood), `?r` (rock)\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - The person must have the rock (`person_has ?p ?r`).\n     - The wood must be intact and not yet carved (`wood_intact ?w`, `not (groove_carved ?w)`).\n   - **Effects**:\n     - A groove is carved into the wood (`groove_carved ?w`).\n     - The condition of the wood changes to grooved (`wood_condition ?w grooved`).\n\n2. **Action: start-fire**\n   - **Parameters**: `?p` (person), `?w` (wood), `?f` (friction_tool)\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - The wood must have a groove (`groove_carved ?w`).\n     - The person must have a friction tool (`person_has ?p ?f`).\n     - The fire has not yet been started (`not (fire_started)`).\n   - **Effects**:\n     - A fire is started (`fire_started`).\n     - The wood is used for fire (`wood_condition ?w used_for_fire`).\n\nThese actions are designed to logically progress from carving a groove in the wood to starting a fire, aligning with the task's objective.",
    "Sure, let's generate the PDDL actions for the task \"escape_island\" based on the provided steps and descriptions.\n\nTask: escape_island\n\nSteps:\n1. get_water npc water\n2. carve_groove person wood rock\n\nDescriptions:\n- Ration all of your supplies. Do not waste anything, even if you have an overabundance of it. Store away your excess food and water and stick to strict rationing. The body requires 32 ounces of water a day and 200-1500 calories of food for an average person.\n- Hunt for fish, insects, and small animals for food. The protein and nutrients from meat and fish will give you energy. Mollusks, clams, oysters, crabs, muscles, and fish are all things that you may be able to find in the shallow waters surrounding or on an island.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```pddl\n(:action get_water\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?w - water)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?npc island)\n                    (water-available ?w))\n    :effect (and\n              (has_water ?npc ?w)\n              (not (water-available ?w))\n             )\n  )\n\n(:action carve_groove\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - wood ?r - rock)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_tool ?p ?r)\n                    (has_material ?p ?w)\n                    (at ?p island))\n    :effect (and\n              (groove_carved ?w)\n              (not (has_material ?p ?w))\n             )\n  )\n\n(:action ration_supplies\n    :parameters (?p - person ?w - water)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_water ?p ?w)\n                    (at ?p island))\n    :effect (and\n              (rationed ?w)\n             )\n  )\n\n(:action hunt_for_food\n    :parameters (?p - person ?f - food)\n    :precondition (at ?p island)\n    :effect (and\n              (has_food ?p ?f)\n             )\n  )\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **get_water**: This action allows an NPC to obtain water if it is available on the island. Preconditions ensure the NPC is on the island and the water is available. The effect is that the NPC now has the water, and it is no longer available (assumed to be limited supply).\n\n2. **carve_groove**: This action involves a person using a rock to carve a groove into a piece of wood. Preconditions ensure the person has both the rock and the wood and is on the island. The effect is that the wood now has a groove, and the material (wood) is used up.\n\n3. **ration_supplies**: This action is about rationing the water supplies. Preconditions ensure that the person has the water and is on the island. The effect is that the water is now rationed.\n\n4. **hunt_for_food**: This action allows the person to hunt for food on the island. Preconditions ensure the person is on the island. The effect is that the person now has food. \n\nThese actions align with the provided steps and descriptions, ensuring the logic and intent of the task \"escape_island\" are captured effectively."

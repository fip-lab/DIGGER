    "To generate the PDDL actions for the given task, we need to translate the provided step into an appropriate action. The task involves sliding a credit card into the side of a door to unlock it. Let's break this down into a PDDL action following the example structure.\n\n### Task: pick_easy_lock\n\n#### Step:\n- slide_into_side_of_door user1 creditcard1 lock1\n\n#### Descriptions:\n- Put the credit card into the side of the door. Slide the long end of a credit card in between the door frame and the locking side of the door, just above where the lock enters the frame.\n\n### PDDL Actions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action SlideCardIntoDoor\n    :parameters (?u - user ?c - card ?l - lock)\n    :precondition (and\n        (atLocation ?u ?l)\n        (holds ?u ?c)\n        (isCreditCard ?c)\n        (isLock ?l)\n        (doorLocked ?l)\n        )\n    :effect (and\n        (not (doorLocked ?l))\n        (doorUnlocked ?l)\n        (not (holds ?u ?c))\n        (cardInDoor ?c ?l)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Action Name**: `SlideCardIntoDoor` - This name reflects the action of sliding the credit card into the door lock.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `?u` represents the user performing the action.\n  - `?c` represents the credit card being used.\n  - `?l` represents the lock on the door.\n- **Preconditions**: \n  - The user must be at the location of the lock (`atLocation ?u ?l`).\n  - The user must be holding the credit card (`holds ?u ?c`).\n  - The object being used must be a credit card (`isCreditCard ?c`).\n  - The object being manipulated must be a lock (`isLock ?l`).\n  - The door must initially be locked (`doorLocked ?l`).\n- **Effects**: \n  - The door becomes unlocked (`doorUnlocked ?l`).\n  - The door is no longer locked (`not (doorLocked ?l)`).\n  - The user no longer holds the credit card (`not (holds ?u ?c)`).\n  - The credit card is now in the door (`cardInDoor ?c ?l`).\n\nThis PDDL action captures the essence of using a credit card to unlock a door by sliding it into the lock, as described in the task and step."

    "Sure, here are the PDDL actions for the task \"build_shelter\":\n\nTask: build_shelter\n\nSteps:\n- make_splash npc path oak_log branch\n- drink_water npc\n- build_shelter npc camp teepee_structure\n- place_branch npc west_plain branch_piece\n\nDescriptions:\n- Insert 1 end of the branch into the split of 1 of the trees. Where the tree splits and forms a \u201cV\u201d shape, place 1 end of the branch to hold it up as a support beam. If the tree doesn't have a split, use a log that ends in a \u201cV\u201d shape and lean it against a tree so the branch is supported by the tree.\n- In the event that you have no containers and no way to purify water, you can dig a deep hole, let it fill with groundwater, and wait for the particles to settle at the bottom and the water is clear before you drink it. You should only do this if you have no other option.\n- Find a branch 10 feet (3.0 m) long and 3\u20136 inches (7.6\u201315.2 cm) thick. To form your shelter you need a support beam, so look for a sturdy tree branch that isn't rotting. The straighter the branch, the better it will be for forming the structure of your shelter.\n- Place the other end of the branch into the split of the other tree. Form a horizontal frame with the main branch by inserting the other end in the split of a nearby tree. Make sure the branch is firmly held in place by shaking it a little.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n```lisp\n(:action make_splash\n    :parameters (?npc - character ?p - path ?o - oak_log ?b - branch)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?p) (not (used ?o ?b)))\n    :effect (used ?o ?b)\n  )\n\n(:action drink_water\n    :parameters (?npc - character)\n    :precondition (and (thirsty ?npc) (has_no_container ?npc))\n    :effect (not (thirsty ?npc))\n  )\n\n(:action build_shelter\n    :parameters (?npc - character ?c - camp ?t - teepee_structure)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?c) (has_materials ?npc))\n    :effect (built ?t)\n  )\n\n(:action place_branch\n    :parameters (?npc - character ?wp - west_plain ?bp - branch_piece)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?wp) (not (placed ?bp)))\n    :effect (placed ?bp)\n  )\n```",
    "Sure, here's the PDDL actions for the given task \"eat_plants\":\n\n### PDDL Actions for Task: eat_plants\n\n#### Step 1: get_water\n**Description:** Search for a source of fresh water.\n\n```pddl\n(:action get_water\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?water - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n      (npc_thirsty ?npc)\n      (fresh_water_source ?water)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (npc_hydrated ?npc)\n      (not (npc_thirsty ?npc))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### Step 2: eat_fruit\n**Description:** Pick wild edible berries to eat. If you happen to come by an identifiable berry bush, definitely take advantage. Never consume any berries that you cannot positively identify as many are toxic. To be safe, stick to eating berries that you recognize like blackberries, raspberries, and wild strawberries.\n\n```pddl\n(:action eat_fruit\n    :parameters (?npc - agent ?fruit - plant)\n    :precondition (and\n      (npc_hungry ?npc)\n      (edible_fruit ?fruit)\n      (identified_fruit ?fruit)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (npc_fed ?npc)\n      (not (npc_hungry ?npc))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Summary\n- The `get_water` action ensures that the NPC can find and drink fresh water to quench their thirst.\n- The `eat_fruit` action allows the NPC to pick and eat identifiable and edible wild berries to satisfy their hunger.\n\nThese actions capture the intent and logic of the steps provided in the task \"eat_plants\".",
    "To generate PDDL actions for the task \"build_snare,\" we need to consider the provided step and descriptions. However, the provided step \"get_snare npc snare\" seems to be incomplete and doesn't directly relate to the task of building a snare. Therefore, I will interpret it as part of the process of building a snare, which typically involves setting up a snare trap. Additionally, the description about mushrooms is not directly related to building a snare, so it will be ignored for the purpose of generating relevant PDDL actions.\n\nHere are the PDDL actions based on the interpreted task of building a snare:\n\n### PDDL Actions for Building a Snare\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Gather Materials for Snare\n(:action gather_materials\n    :parameters (?s - snare)\n    :precondition (not (materials_gathered ?s))\n    :effect (materials_gathered ?s)\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Set Up Snare\n(:action setup_snare\n    :parameters (?s - snare)\n    :precondition (materials_gathered ?s)\n    :effect (snare_setup ?s)\n)\n\n;; Action 3: Place Snare\n(:action place_snare\n    :parameters (?s - snare ?l - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (snare_setup ?s)\n                    (not (snare_placed ?s))\n                  )\n    :effect (snare_placed ?s)\n)\n\n;; Action 4: Check Snare\n(:action check_snare\n    :parameters (?s - snare)\n    :precondition (snare_placed ?s)\n    :effect (snare_checked ?s)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **gather_materials**: This action involves gathering the necessary materials to build a snare. The precondition is that the materials have not yet been gathered, and the effect is that they are gathered.\n\n2. **setup_snare**: This action involves setting up the snare using the gathered materials. The precondition is that the materials have been gathered, and the effect is that the snare is set up.\n\n3. **place_snare**: This action involves placing the snare in a suitable location. The precondition is that the snare is set up and not yet placed, and the effect is that the snare is placed.\n\n4. **check_snare**: This action involves checking the snare after it has been placed. The precondition is that the snare is placed, and the effect is that the snare is checked.\n\nThese actions collectively represent the process of building and deploying a snare."

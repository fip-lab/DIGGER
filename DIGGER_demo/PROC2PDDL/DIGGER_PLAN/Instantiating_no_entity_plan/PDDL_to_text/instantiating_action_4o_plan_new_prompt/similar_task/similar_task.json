An underground bunker isn’t only the best for the time of impact; it will also protect you from environmental hazards after the comet has hit. When the comet hits, dust, soot, and water will shoot up into our atmosphere, making it cold for months to years.",

You can use it to produce heat, cook food, and power lights. However, because most generators run on fuel, it’s important that you limit its usage because you will likely have a limited amount of fuel in your bunker. If you aren't in a bunker, a generator may still work, but there's a good chance that the main power grid will be down.",

You are a brilliant AI specialist in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language), tasked with generating strictly formatted PDDL planning steps for a new task.

## Task Description
Define the task objectives. Select appropriate actions from the provided instantiated action set and combine them logically to generate a series of steps that achieve the goal.

# Action Selection and Combination Guidance
1. **Select actions that support mission completion:** Choose only those actions that directly contribute to achieving the goal.
2. **Ensure alignment with task requirements:** Each action must be consistent with the mission requirements and drive the task toward its objective.
3. **Arrange actions in logical sequence:** Order the actions according to the complexity of the task and the dependencies between them.
4. **Consider dependencies:** Some actions may require the result or condition of a previous action. Ensure these dependencies are respected.
5. **Dynamically adjust based on progress:** Modify the sequence as necessary based on the current status of the task.
6. **Deeply consider various planning forms:** Use your self-judgment to choose the most appropriate steps that truly satisfy the task requirements.
7. **Ensure appropriateness:** When choosing an action, always consider current conditions to guarantee that each step is appropriate.
8.**Operability and specificity of the steps:**Emphasize that each step should be as specific and actionable as possible. For example, require each step to clearly identify a tool or material. This ensures that the generated steps are more realistic and avoids actions that are too abstract or vague.
### Note:
The provided Goal_state is for reference only and does not necessarily represent the correct or unique target state. The generated planning steps must ensure logical coherence and valid state changes, but they do not have to force the final state to exactly match the reference.

# Output Requirements:
1. **Strict PDDL Format:** Output only in PDDL, with no natural language descriptions or action definitions.
2. **Step Structure:** Each step must include an action name and the corresponding parameters.

# Step Constraint:
The plan should contain a maximum of {max_steplen} steps (Â±1-2 steps). If the goal has been partially accomplished, the generated plan can be appropriately reduced in the number of steps. Each step should effectively change the state of the entity, be concise and actionable, and move the task toward the final goal.
### Task:
{task_description}

### Goal_state (Reference Only):
{goal_state}

### Action set:
{instantiating_action}

### Example Workflow:
1.By learning examples of similar tasks, understand how to generate target steps and refer to their generated steps.
2.Logically combine operations to build a complete PDDL plan, ensuring that the sequence of steps drives tasks toward the end goal.Examples for Reference:

The agent must be at the location of the object, the object must be on the location, and the agent must have a free hand to perform this action. After the action, the agent is holding the object, and the object is no longer on the location.\n\n2. **Action 2 (move_agent):** This action represents the agent moving from one location (Bed1) to another location (Desk1). The agent must be at the starting location, and the two locations must be connected for this action to be performed. After the action, the agent is at the new location and no longer at the starting location.\n\n3. **Action 3 (put_object):** This action represents the agent placing the laptop on the desk. The agent must be holding the object and must be at the location where the object is to be placed. After the action, the object is on the location, and the agent's hand is free again.\n\n4. **Action 4 (move_agent):** This action represents the agent moving from Drawer1 to Bed1. The preconditions and effects are the same as Action 2, but the locations are different.\n\n### Notes:\n- The task involves moving the laptop from Bed1 to Desk1, which is achieved through Actions 1, 2, and 3.\n- Action 4 is included as it is part of the provided steps, representing the agent's movement from Drawer1 to Bed1.\n- Preconditions like `connected` ensure that the locations are navigable, and `free_hand` ensures that the agent can only pick up objects if not already holding something.",

The preconditions ensure that the agent is currently at the starting location and that the two locations are connected. The effect updates the agent's location.\n\n2. **`pickupobjectnoreceptacle`**: This action allows the agent to pick up an object (in this case, `cellphone1`) from a location (in this case, `drawer1`) without the use of a receptacle. Preconditions ensure the agent is at the location and the object is present there.\n\n3. **`putobjectinreceptacle`**: This action allows the agent to place the object (`cellphone1`) into a receptacle (`box1`). Preconditions ensure the agent is holding the object and is at the location of the receptacle, and the receptacle is empty. The effect updates the state to reflect that the object is now in the receptacle and the agent is no longer holding it.\n\n4. **`gotolocation` (reused)**: The same action is reused to represent the agent's movement from `drawer1` to `box1`.\n\n### Notes:\n- The `gotolocation` action is reused for both movement steps because the logic is identical for moving between any two connected locations.\n- Preconditions and effects are designed to reflect the logical requirements and outcomes of each step.\n- The task is focused on moving the cellphone (`cellphone1`) from `drawer1` to `box1`, and the PDDL actions align with this objective.",

Preconditions ensure the agent is at the starting location and that the two locations are connected. Effects update the agent's location.\n\n2. **`pickup_object`**: This action allows the agent to pick up the cellphone (CellPhone1) from a receptacle (Drawer1). Preconditions ensure the agent is at the receptacle's location, the object is in the receptacle, and the agent is not already holding the object. The effects update the state to show the agent is holding the object and the object is no longer in the receptacle.\n\n3. **`put_object_on_receptacle`**: This action is used to place the cellphone on the sofa (Sofa1). Preconditions ensure the agent is at the sofa's location, is holding the object, and the receptacle is not prohibited (e.g., not Box1). The effects update the state to show the object is now in the receptacle and the agent is no longer holding it.\n\n4. **`prohibit_receptacle`**: This action is used to explicitly mark a receptacle (e.g., Box1) as prohibited for placing the specified object. This ensures the agent does not place the cellphone in Box1.\n\n---\n\n### Task-Specific Adjustments:\n- The steps involving moving the agent (`gotolocation`) have been generalized into the `move_agent` action.\n- The step to pick up the cellphone (`pickupobjectnoreceptacle`) has been adjusted to ensure the agent picks it up from Drawer1.\n- The step to put the cellphone on the sofa (`putobjectinreceptacle`) has been modified to include a condition that ensures the object is not placed in a prohibited receptacle (Box1).\n- A new action (`prohibit_receptacle`) has been added to explicitly prohibit placing the cellphone in Box1, as per the task's requirement.\n\nThis set of actions ensures that the task is completed correctly while adhering to the constraints provided.",

The precondition checks that the agent is currently at the starting location and that the locations are connected. The effect updates the agent's location.\n\n2. **`putobjectinreceptacle` (Action 2)**: This action enables the agent to place an object into a receptacle. The precondition ensures the agent is at the receptacle's location, holding the object, and that the receptacle is empty. The effect updates the state to reflect the object being in the receptacle and the receptacle no longer being empty.\n\n3. **`gotolocation` (Action 3)**: This is a repeat of the `gotolocation` action, but for a different movement (desk1 to sofa1). The logic remains the same as the first `gotolocation` action.\n\n4. **`pickupobjectnoreceptacle` (Action 4)**: This action allows the agent to pick up an object from a location without a receptacle. The precondition ensures the agent and the object are at the same location and that the agent is not already holding the object. The effect updates the state to reflect the agent holding the object and the object no longer being at the location.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n\n- The `gotolocation` action is reused for both Step 1 and Step 3, as the logic for moving between locations is the same.\n- The `putobjectinreceptacle` action corresponds to Step 2, where the agent places the laptop into the box.\n- The `pickupobjectnoreceptacle` action corresponds to Step 4, where the agent picks up the laptop from the sofa.\n- Preconditions and effects are carefully designed to ensure logical consistency and adherence to the task's intent.\n\n",

The precondition ensures the agent is holding the object, the receptacle is valid, and the object is not placed in a box (`Box1`).\n\n---\n\n### Adjusted Steps and Corresponding Actions:\n\n1. **Original Step:** `gotolocation agent1 desk1 drawer1`  \n   **Action:** `gotolocation`  \n   **Explanation:** Agent moves from `desk1` to `drawer1`.\n\n2. **Original Step:** `putobjectinreceptacle agent1 pen1 sofa1`  \n   **Action:** `putobjectinreceptacle`  \n   **Explanation:** Agent places `pen1` on `sofa1` (ensuring it is not placed in `Box1`).\n\n3. **Original Step:** `pickupobjectnoreceptacle agent1 pen1 drawer1`  \n   **Action:** `pickupobjectnoreceptacle`  \n   **Explanation:** Agent picks up `pen1` from `drawer1`.\n\n4. **Original Step:** `gotolocation agent1 drawer1 sofa1`  \n   **Action:** `gotolocation`  \n   **Explanation:** Agent moves from `drawer1` to `sofa1`.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n\n- The step sequence has been slightly adjusted to ensure logical consistency with the task and descriptions.\n- The preconditions and effects are designed to prevent the pen from being placed in `Box1`, as specified in the task.

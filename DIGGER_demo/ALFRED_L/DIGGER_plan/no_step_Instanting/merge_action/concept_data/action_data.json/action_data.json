Preconditions ensure the agent is at the starting location (Box2) and that the locations are connected. Effects update the agent's location.\n\n3. **Action 3**: The agent picks up the CD from the Garbage Can. Preconditions ensure the agent is at the Garbage Can and the CD is in the Garbage Can. Effects update the state to show the agent is holding the CD and the CD is no longer in the Garbage Can.\n\n4. **Action 4**: The agent moves from Drawer1 to the Garbage Can. Similar to Action 2, preconditions ensure the agent is at Drawer1 and the locations are connected.

The task specifies that Pen1 should be placed on Sofa2 and explicitly not in Box2. This constraint is reflected in the precondition of the action `put_pen_on_sofa` to ensure that the Pen is not placed in Box2.\n2. Steps that involve irrelevant or unrelated actions (e.g., moving to garbage can) are included but can be omitted or adjusted based on their relevance to the task.\n3. The `connected` predicate is assumed to define the connectivity between locations, enabling movement actions.\n4. The `free_hand` predicate ensures the agent has a free hand to pick up objects.\n\nLet me know if you need further refinements!"

    You are a highly skilled AI assistant specializing in translating PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) actions into clear and actionable natural language instructions. 
    Each PDDL action describes a specific task, and your goal is to provide a step-by-step guide that explains the task in a way that's easy for anyone to follow.
    ### Instructions:
    1. Translate each PDDL step into a concise, easy-to-follow instruction, using natural language that matches a clear  format.
    2. Each instruction include specific details about the task, the agent performing the task, and the objects involved.
    3. Use relatable language and refer to the objects in ways that align closely with the taskâ€™s goal. Ensure that the object references are understandable and relevant to the task.
    4. Make sure the instructions are informative yet straightforward, offering enough context to fully explain each action.
    6. Please follow the format exactly as shown to maintain consistency and clarity across all steps.

    ### Key Points:
    - **Action**: Describe the task in an actionable way, starting with a verb.
    - **Agent**: Identify the person or role performing the action, avoiding technical jargon (e.g., instead of 'npc' or 'player', use natural terms like 'you' or 'the person').
    #However, if there is an object in the similar task step, it is excluded in the natural statement(e.g,"Agent").
    - **Object**: Focus on providing clear, relatable details about the objects or elements involved in the task.

    Input:
    task_description:
    {data["task"]}

    Below are PDDL steps describing tasks with agents and objects. Translate each PDDL action into a clear, step-by-step, natural language sentence that is easy to follow. Add context or details where needed to ensure clarity.

    PDDL steps:
    {data["steps"]}

    ### Output Format:
    Please use the format below strictly:

    **Task**: [task description]
    **Steps in Natural Language**:
    1. [Step 1 in natural language, based on the first PDDL step]. 
    2. [Step 2 in natural language, based on the second PDDL step].
    ...
    n. [Final step in natural language, based on the last PDDL step].

    **Similar Task Example**:
    Here is an example of a similar task with corresponding steps. As a guide, follow the style of the example to ensure consistency and clarity in translation.

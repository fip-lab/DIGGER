    "Here is the consolidated and merged action for the `move` category based on the provided examples:\n\n### Merged Action: `move`\n```lisp\n(:action move\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?from - location ?to - location)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (at ?agent ?from) \n                    (connected ?from ?to))\n    :effect (and \n              (not (at ?agent ?from)) \n              (at ?agent ?to))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?from`, `?to`) to represent any possible movement of an agent between locations. This generalization makes it adaptable to a variety of movement-related tasks.\n   - The predicate `connected` ensures the action is only applicable if the two locations (`?from` and `?to`) are navigable.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The `precondition` ensures that the agent is currently at the `from` location and that the `from` and `to` locations are connected.\n   - The `effect` updates the state by removing the `at ?agent ?from` predicate and adding the `at ?agent ?to` predicate, accurately reflecting the agent's new position.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The core logic of movement actions (checking for connection and updating the agent's location) is retained from all the individual actions. This ensures simplicity and logical consistency.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - All movement-related actions (e.g., moving to `box2`, `garbagecan`, `drawer`, etc.) are merged into a single action, removing duplication and unnecessary complexity.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action is logically consistent across all tasks, as the `precondition` and `effect` structure remains valid regardless of the context or specific locations involved.\n\n---\n\n### Final Note:\nThe merged `move` action is adaptable to any task where an agent needs to navigate between connected locations. It is abstract enough to handle all the given scenarios while maintaining simplicity, avoiding redundancy, and ensuring logical consistency.",
    "### Merged Universal Action for \"Put\" Tasks:\n```pddl\n(:action put ; A universal action for placing objects into/on receptacles\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?object - item ?receptacle - receptacle)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (holding ?agent ?object)\n                    (at ?agent ?receptacle)\n                    (receptacle ?receptacle)\n                    (clear ?receptacle)) ; Ensures receptacle is not occupied\n    :effect (and\n              (in ?object ?receptacle) ; Object is now in/on the receptacle\n              (not (holding ?agent ?object)) ; Agent is no longer holding the object\n              (free_hands ?agent)) ; Agent's hands are now free\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\nThis universal `put` action consolidates all the similar actions for placing objects into/on receptacles, such as putting pens, books, keychains, etc., into boxes, sofas, or desks. Here's how it satisfies the criteria:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters: `?agent` (agent performing the action), `?object` (item being placed), and `?receptacle` (destination).\n   - It applies to a wide range of tasks involving placing objects into/on various receptacles.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the agent is holding the object, is at the location of the receptacle, and the receptacle is clear.\n   - Effects update the state to reflect that the object is now in/on the receptacle, the agent is no longer holding the object, and their hands are free.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - All redundant actions for placing specific objects (e.g., `put_pen_in_box2`, `put_book_on_sofa`, etc.) are merged into this single, universal action.\n   - The precondition `(clear ?receptacle)` ensures logical consistency by preventing placing objects on already occupied receptacles.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action ensures that the object is properly placed and that the agent's state transitions (e.g., hands becoming free) are consistent across tasks.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Covers Previous Examples:\n1. **`put_pen_in_box2`**:\n   - Parameters: `?agent` = `agent1`, `?object` = `pen1`, `?receptacle` = `box2`.\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent with the universal action.\n\n2. **`put_book_on_sofa`**:\n   - Parameters: `?agent` = `agent1`, `?object` = `book1`, `?receptacle` = `sofa1`.\n   - The universal action captures the same logic for placing the book on the sofa.\n\n3. **`put_cellphone_on_sofa`**:\n   - Parameters: `?agent` = `agent1`, `?object` = `cellphone1`, `?receptacle` = `sofa1`.\n   - The action ensures the cellphone is placed on the sofa and not in any other container (e.g., Box1).\n\n4. **`put_keychain_in_sofa`**:\n   - Parameters: `?agent` = `agent1`, `?object` = `keychain1`, `?receptacle` = `sofa3`.\n   - The universal action handles this task seamlessly.\n\n5. **`put_object_in_desk`**:\n   - Parameters: `?agent` = `agent1`, `?object` = `pencil1`, `?receptacle` = `desk`.\n   - Preconditions and effects align perfectly with the universal action.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of the Merged Action:\n- **Scalability**: New tasks involving different objects or receptacles can be handled without creating new actions.\n- **Efficiency**: Reduces redundancy by combining all similar actions into one.\n- **Clarity**: Maintains logical consistency and simplicity in task representation.\n\nThis merged action ensures seamless adaptability to a wide range of \"put\" tasks while adhering to the core principles of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",

It is not specific to one type of agent or task.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure the agent starts at the `from` location and the two locations are connected.\n   - Effects update the state to reflect the agent's movement: the agent is no longer at the `from` location but is now at the `to` location.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundant details or task-specific constraints have been removed. The action is focused purely on movement between locations.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and ensure the action can only occur if the agent is at the correct starting location and the locations are connected.\n\n5. **Adaptability:**\n   - The merged action can be applied to various tasks involving movement, as the parameters (`?agent`, `?from`, `?to`) and predicates (`at`, `connected`) are abstract and widely applicable.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The `connected` predicate must be properly defined in the domain to indicate valid paths between locations.\n- This merged `go` action is now a universal movement operator that can be used across different PDDL domains and tasks.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance or additional merged actions for other tasks!",

It is both general and adaptable to different scenarios while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity.\n\n#### Key Features:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action applies to multiple scenarios: picking up items from surfaces (e.g., desks, tables) and picking up items from enclosed receptacles (e.g., drawers, boxes).\n   - Abstract parameters such as `?item`, `?location`, and `?receptacle` make the action flexible for varied tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the item is either \"on\" a location or \"in\" a receptacle and that the agent is at the location with free hands.\n   - Effects transition the state to reflect that the item is now held by the agent and is no longer at its original location or in the receptacle.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The core logic of picking up an item is retained. The action ensures that items are only picked up under permissible conditions and that the state transitions are logically consistent.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By merging similar actions (e.g., `pickup_pen`, `pickup_book_from_box`, `pickup_from_drawer`), the redundant definitions are eliminated, and a single universal action is created.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable across different contexts. For example, the `or` condition in the preconditions ensures the action is valid regardless of whether the item is on a surface or inside a receptacle.\n\n---\n\n### Example Scenarios for the Merged Action\n#### Scenario 1: Picking up a pen from a desk\n```pddl\n(:init\n    (at agent1 desk1)\n    (on pen1 desk1)\n    (free_hands agent1)\n    (not (holding agent1 pen1))\n)\n(:goal\n    (holding agent1 pen1)\n)\n```\n- The agent is at `desk1`, the `pen1` is on the desk, and the agent has free hands. The `pickup` action applies, resulting in the agent holding the pen.\n\n#### Scenario 2: Picking up a book from a box\n```pddl\n(:init\n    (at agent1 box1)\n    (in book1 box1)\n    (free_hands agent1)\n    (not (holding agent1 book1))\n)\n(:goal\n    (holding agent1 book1)\n)\n```\n- The agent is at `box1`, the `book1` is inside the box, and the agent has free hands. The `pickup` action applies, resulting in the agent holding the book.\n\n#### Scenario 3: Picking up a cellphone from a drawer\n```pddl\n(:init\n    (at agent1 drawer1)\n    (in cellphone1 drawer1)\n    (free_hands agent1)\n    (not (holding agent1 cellphone1))\n)\n(:goal\n    (holding agent1 cellphone1)\n)\n```\n- The agent is at `drawer1`, the `cellphone1` is inside the drawer, and the agent has free hands. The `pickup` action applies, resulting in the agent holding the cellphone.\n\n---\n\nThis merged `pickup` action can now be reused across a variety of tasks involving an agent picking up objects from different locations or receptacles. It is simple, efficient, and applicable to a wide range of scenarios.",
    "To merge all the provided `gotolocation` actions into a single, universal action that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to identify the commonalities and abstract them into a single action. Here's the merged action:\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: gotolocation**\n```lisp\n(:action gotolocation\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?from - location ?to - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (at ?agent ?from)\n                    (connected ?from ?to))\n    :effect (and\n              (at ?agent ?to)\n              (not (at ?agent ?from)))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action**\n1. **Generalization:**\n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters like `?from` and `?to` to represent any starting and destination locations, respectively, and `?agent` to represent any entity moving between these locations.\n   - The specific cases of moving between `bed` to `drawer`, `drawer` to `box`, or any other pair of locations are now generalized under the abstract parameters `?from` and `?to`.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The action ensures a clear state change by updating the agent's location from `?from` to `?to`.\n   - It also removes the `at ?agent ?from` condition to ensure the agent is no longer considered at the starting location after moving.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundancy is avoided by merging all location-specific actions (e.g., `gotolocation_bed_to_drawer`, `gotolocation_drawer_to_box`, etc.) into one universal action.\n   - By using abstract parameters, we eliminate the need for multiple similar actions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across all contexts, ensuring that the `?agent` can only move if it is currently at the starting location (`?from`) and if the two locations are connected.\n   - The movement's effects are logically consistent with the intended state changes.\n\n---\n\n### **Result**\nThe merged action `gotolocation` can now be used for any task involving movement between connected locations, regardless of the specific locations or the entity performing the movement. For example:\n- Moving `agent1` from `desk1` to `box2`.\n- Moving `agent1` from `bed` to `drawer`.\n- Moving between any other `?from` and `?to` as long as they are connected.\n\nThis universal action is efficient, adaptable, and logically sound, covering all the cases described in the original action set.",

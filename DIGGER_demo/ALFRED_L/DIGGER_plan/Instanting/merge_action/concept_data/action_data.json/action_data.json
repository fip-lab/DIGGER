The effects reflect the agent holding the object and the object no longer being on the location.\n   \n2. **Step 2:** The action `go_to_location` handles the movement of the agent from `bed1` to `desk1`. Preconditions ensure the agent is at the starting location and the locations are connected. Effects update the agent's location.\n\n3. **Step 3:** The action `put_object_in_receptacle` reflects placing the laptop on the desk. Preconditions ensure the agent is holding the object, is at the correct location, and the location is a receptacle. Effects update the state to reflect the object being on the location, the agent no longer holding the object, and the agent having free hands.\n\n4. **Step 4:** The action `go_to_location` is reused for moving the agent from `drawer1` to `bed1`, as it aligns with the task description. Preconditions and effects are similar to Step 2, ensuring valid movement between locations.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The `connected` predicate is assumed to represent the connectivity between locations, which must be defined in the domain.\n- The `free_hands` predicate ensures that the agent can only pick up objects if their hands are not already occupied.\n- The `receptacle` predicate is used to indicate valid locations where objects can be placed.\n- Irrelevant or incorrect steps were not present, so no modifications were needed.\n"

The precondition ensures the agent is at the starting location and that the locations are connected.\n\n2. **Pick Up CellPhone1 from Bed1**: The agent picks up the cellphone from Bed1. The preconditions ensure the agent is at Bed1, the cellphone is on Bed1, and it is clear to pick up. The effects update the state to reflect that the agent is now holding the cellphone.\n\n3. **Move Agent to Sofa2 from Bed1**: The agent moves from Bed1 to Sofa2. This step ensures the agent is at the correct location to place the cellphone on the sofa.\n\n4. **Place CellPhone1 on Sofa2**: The agent places the cellphone on Sofa2. The preconditions ensure the agent is holding the cellphone, is at Sofa2, and that the cellphone is not placed in Box3. The effects update the state to reflect that the cellphone is now on Sofa2 and no longer held by the agent.\n\n---\n\n### Irrelevant Steps:\nThe following steps were deemed irrelevant to the task and omitted:\n- Moving to Box1 or Drawer1.\n- Picking up Book1 or placing it in Sofa2.\n- Any actions involving Box3, as the task explicitly states not to put the cellphone in Box3.\n\n### Task-Specific Adjustments:\n- A constraint `(not (in ?object box3))` was added to the action for placing the cellphone to ensure it is not placed in Box3, as specified in the task description.\n- Actions unrelated to the task (e.g., handling Book1 or moving to unrelated locations) were excluded.\n\nThis set of actions ensures that the task is completed as per the requirements while adhering to the PDDL structure."

move CellPhone1 to Bed1 with more object,"Here is a possible solution for this task. This assumes that you're using a programming language that supports object-oriented programming and that your objects have methods for moving them:

```python
class CellPhone:
    def __init__(self, position):
        self.position = position

    def move(self, new_position):
        self.position = new_position
        print(f'CellPhone has been moved to {new_position}')

class Bed:
    def __init__(self, position):
        self.position = position

class Room:
    def __init__(self, objects):
        self.objects = objects

    def find_object(self, object_name):
        for obj in self.objects:
            if type(obj).__name__ == object_name:
                return obj
        return None

    def move_object(self, object_name, new_position):
        obj = self.find_object(object_name)
        if obj is not None:
            obj.move(new_position)
        else:
            print(f'No {object_name} found in the room.')

# Initialize objects
cell_phone1 = CellPhone('Table1')
bed1 = Bed('Corner1')
room = Room([cell_phone1, bed1])

# Move cell_phone1 to bed1
room.move_object('CellPhone', 'Bed1')
```

This script first creates a CellPhone class and a Bed class, each with a position attribute. Then, it creates a Room class that contains a list of these objects. The Room class has a method to find an object by its class name and a method to move an object to a new position. The script then initializes a cell phone and a bed, puts them in a room, and moves the cell phone to the bed."

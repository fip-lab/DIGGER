The basement's state changes to \"haven.\"\n\n10. **`honor_family`**: Honoring ancestors or family is reflected by this action. The family's state changes to \"honored.\"\n\n11. **`get_into_garden`**: Getting into the garden is represented here. The NPC's location changes to the garden.\n\n---\n\n### Notes on Task-Specific Adjustments\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps were modified to align with the task's context (e.g., \"injured person bathroom npc\" was interpreted as assisting an injured person to the bathroom).\n- Each action includes task-specific preconditions and effects that reflect the described state transitions of entities.\n- The actions are concise and adhere to the PDDL format, ensuring clarity and logical consistency.\n(:action buy_item\n    :parameters (?item - item ?p - person ?s - store)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?s) (available ?item ?s))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?item) (not (available ?item ?s)))\n)\n\n\n(:action buy_gifts\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (and (decorated ?npc) (visible ?npc))\n    :effect (and (invisible ?npc) (not (visible ?npc)))\n)\n```\n**Explanation:** Buying gifts involves interacting with the `npc` (representing the gift). After the gift is purchased, it transitions from `visible` to `invisible`.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Take Dad to a Sporting Event or Concert**\n```lisp\n\n(:action gather_amazed\n    :parameters (?p - person ?teachers - group)\n    :precondition (and (graduated ?p high_school) (teachers_available ?teachers))\n    :effect (and (appreciation_expressed ?p ?teachers))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Each Action:\n\n1. **plan_vacation**:\n   - **Parameters**: The person planning the vacation (`?p`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person must have graduated from high school (`graduated ?p high_school`).\n   - **Effects**: The vacation is planned (`vacation_planned ?p`).\n\n2. **throw_party**:\n   - **Parameters**: The person throwing the party (`?p`) and the location of the party (`?l`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person must have graduated, must be at the location, and the location must be ready (`location_is_ready ?l`).\n   - **Effects**: A party is thrown at the location (`party_thrown ?p ?l`).\n\n3. **buy_item**:\n   - **Parameters**: The item being bought (`?item`), the person buying it (`?p`), and the store where the item is located (`?s`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person must be at the store, and the item must be available (`available ?item ?s`).\n   - **Effects**: The item is added to the person\u2019s inventory, and it is no longer available in the store.\n\n4. **invite_parent_dinner**:\n   - **Parameters**: The person inviting their parent to dinner (`?p`), the parent being invited (`?parent`), and the dinner itself (`?d`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person must have graduated, and the dinner must be prepared (`dinner_prepared ?d`).\n   - **Effects**: The parent is invited to the dinner, and the dinner is shared between the person and the parent.\n\n5. **construct_memory_book**:\n   - **Parameters**: The person constructing the memory book (`?p`) and the location where it is being constructed (`?l`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person must have graduated, must be at the location, and must have photos and materials for the memory book.\n   - **Effects**: A memory book is created (`memory_book_created ?p`).\n\n6. **gather_amazed**:\n   - **Parameters**: The person expressing appreciation (`?p`) and the group of teachers being appreciated (`?teachers`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The person must have graduated, and the teachers must be available (`teachers_available ?teachers`).\n   - **Effects**: The person expresses appreciation to the teachers (`appreciation_expressed ?p ?teachers`).\n\n---\n\n### Key Considerations:\n\n- **Entity State Changes**:\n  - For each action, the relevant state changes are captured in the effects. For example, in `buy_item`, the item's state changes from `available` to `not available`, and it is added to the person's inventory.\n  - In `throw_party`, the state of the location (`location_is_ready`) ensures that the party can be thrown, and the effect marks the party as thrown.\n\n- **Relevance to Task**:\n  - Each action is aligned with the task steps and descriptions. Irrelevant or unclear steps were modified to fit the context of celebrating a high school graduation.\n\n- **Flexibility**:\n  - The actions are designed to accommodate variations in the task, such as different locations, items, or participants, by using parameters.\n\nThese PDDL actions provide a structured representation of the task and its steps, ensuring that the intent and logic of celebrating a high school graduation are accurately captured.\n(:action gather_members_know ; Use a guest book to assist in recollecting the event\n    :parameters (?p - player ?npc - npc ?gb - guest_book)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p event_location) (at ?npc event_location) (guest_book_available ?gb))\n    :effect (and (event_documented ?gb) (members_recollected ?npc))\n)\n\n\n(:action gather_chocolates\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?location) (not (chocolates_collected ?npc)))\n    :effect (and (chocolates_collected ?npc))\n)\n\n\n(:action find_local_events\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?area - location)\n    :precondition (and (informed ?npc) (not (selected ?area)))\n    :effect (and (selected ?area) (aware_of_events ?npc))\n)\n```\n**Explanation**: This action represents looking for local events to celebrate Black History Month. The `npc` becomes aware of local events, and the `area` transitions from `unselected` to `selected`.\n\n---\n\n#### Action 4: `organize_event`\n```lisp\n\n(:action choose_where_to_hold_party\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?party - event ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (party_planned ?npc) (not (party_location_set ?party)))\n    :effect (and (party_location_set ?party) (party_at ?party ?location))\n)\n\n\n(:action choose_through_visibility\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?passage - passage)\n    :precondition (and (visible ?npc) (not (passage_chosen ?npc)))\n    :effect (and (invisible ?npc) (passage_chosen ?npc ?passage))\n)\n\n\n(:action assign_objectinreceptacle ; assign homework, assignment, and project to students\n   :parameters (?a - agent ?h - homework ?as - assignment ?p - project)\n   :precondition (and (not (assigned ?h)) (not (assigned ?as)) (not (assigned ?p)))\n   :effect (and (assigned ?h) (assigned ?as) (assigned ?p))\n)\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The state of the book changes to read, and a shared experience is created between the player and the daughter.\n\n6. **reassure_with_personal_stories**: This action involves sharing personal stories to reassure the daughter. The state of the stories changes from withheld to given, and the daughter becomes reassured.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n\n- The actions are tailored to the task and focus on the relevant state changes of the entities involved.\n- Some steps were modified or clarified to align with the task's intent, ensuring logical and meaningful actions.\n- Entity state transitions were considered carefully to reflect the before-and-after states in the preconditions and effects.\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

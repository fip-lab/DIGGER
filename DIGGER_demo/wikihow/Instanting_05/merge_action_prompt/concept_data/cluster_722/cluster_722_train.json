The PDDL actions focus on state changes such as treating cysts, checking lumps, and diagnosing Baker\u2019s cysts.\n3.

The precondition checks for the presence of these symptoms, and the effect indicates that care has been received.\n\n2. **`see_doctor_for_persistent_pain`**: Indicates consulting a doctor for persistent pain or related symptoms. The precondition ensures that the individual is experiencing persistent pain, and the effect sets the state to \"doctor consulted.\"\n\n3. **`ask_about_medication`**: Highlights discussing medication options with the doctor to manage painful fibroids. The precondition requires prior consultation with a doctor and the presence of painful fibroids.\n\n4. **`discuss_hormonal_contraceptives`**: Focuses on discussing hormonal contraceptives as a treatment for vaginal bleeding. The precondition ensures that the patient has consulted a doctor and is experiencing vaginal bleeding.\n\n5. **`ask_about_focused_ultrasound`**: Represents discussing MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) as a treatment option. The precondition requires prior consultation with a doctor and the presence of fibroids.\n\n6. **`consider_minimally_invasive_procedures`**: Indicates considering minimally invasive procedures for managing painful fibroids. The precondition checks for the presence of painful fibroids.\n\n7. **`consider_surgery`**: Represents considering surgery as a treatment option when fibroids interfere with daily life. The precondition ensures that the fibroids are significantly impacting the individual's life.\n\n8. **`shrink_fibroids`**: Represents the action of shrinking fibroids after initiating appropriate treatment. This action applies to both the individual (`you`) and others (`npc`).\n\n9. **`listen_to_converter`**: Represents listening to a converter device, which may provide relevant information or support. This step is included as a supplemental action if relevant to the task.\n\n10. **`listen_to_fibroids_information`**: Represents listening to information about fibroids, which helps in understanding the condition and treatment options.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps (e.g., \"fill_bottle npc bathroom\") were omitted or adjusted to focus on the task of shrinking fibroids naturally.\n- The entity states reflect changes in medical care, consultation, treatment options, and the fibroids' condition.\n- The actions are designed to align with the intent and logic of the task while adhering to PDDL conventions.\n(:action seek_treatment_for_ganglion_cyst\n    :parameters (?npc - doctor ?cyst - ganglion_cyst)\n    :precondition (and (present ?cyst) (not (treated ?cyst)) (capable ?npc))\n    :effect (and (treated ?cyst) (not (present ?cyst)))\n)\n\n\n(:action seek_medical_attention\n    :parameters (?p - person ?doctor - doctor ?clinic - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?clinic) (available ?doctor))\n    :effect (and (consulted ?p ?doctor) (not (unaware ?p)))\n)\n```\n**Explanation**: This action represents the person seeking medical attention from a doctor.

Therefore, the entity states involve knowledge and awareness rather than physical attributes like \"location\" or \"composition.\"\n- The `ovarian_customies` entity is treated as a placeholder for symptoms or conditions related to ovarian cysts, and its states are updated to reflect the progress of monitoring and checking symptoms.\n- The `npc` represents the person performing the actions, and their states (`aware`, `informed`, `appointment_scheduled`) capture the progression of their knowledge and actions.\n\nBy structuring the PDDL actions in this way, we ensure that the task is logically represented and the state transitions align with the intent of the steps.\n(:action prepare_for_hemorrhoidectomy\n    :parameters (?p - person ?surgeon - doctor ?hospital - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hospital) (available ?surgeon) (informed ?p))\n    :effect (and (scheduled ?p ?surgeon) (not (unscheduled ?p)))\n)\n```\n**Explanation**: This action represents the person preparing for a hemorrhoidectomy. The precondition ensures the person is at the hospital, the surgeon is available, and the person is informed about the procedure. The effect indicates that the surgery has been scheduled.\n\n---\n\n#### Action 4: Undergo Hemorrhoidectomy\n```lisp\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The step \"be_injured person bathroom npc\" was adjusted to reflect preparation for or undergoing surgery (a hemorrhoidectomy), which aligns with the task description.\n3.

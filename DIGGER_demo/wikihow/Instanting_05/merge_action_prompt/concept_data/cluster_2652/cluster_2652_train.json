The state of the area changes from `unselected` to `selected`.\n2. **`build_bamboo_container`**: Constructs a composting bin. The bin transitions from `empty` and `not constructed` to `constructed` and `ready_for_use`.\n3. **`add_materials`**: Adds organic materials (e.g., grass tinder) to the bin. The material's state changes from `full` to `not full`, and the bin becomes `fuller`.\n4. **`roll_soap`**: Rolls the curing manure pile weekly to aerate it. The bin becomes `rolled` and `aerated`, and its temperature increases (`warmer`).\n5. **`add_water`**: Adds water to the bin to increase moisture. The bin's state changes from `dry` to `wet`, and its temperature increases (`warmer`).\n6. **`get_mixture`**: Examines the compost to determine if it is cured and ready for use. The bin transitions to a `cured` state.\n\nEach action reflects the logical progression and state changes described in the task, ensuring that the entities' attributes are updated appropriately.\n(:action get-wicks-used\n    :parameters (?npc - entity ?wicks - wicks)\n    :precondition (and (available ?wicks) (not (used ?wicks)))\n    :effect (and (used ?wicks) (not (available ?wicks)))\n)\n\n\n(:action get_to_compost_bin\n    :parameters (?bin - bin ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (designated_cleaning_container ?container)\n                    (accessible ?container)\n                    (not (empty ?container))\n                    (empty ?bin))\n    :effect (and\n              (empty ?container)\n              (full ?bin)\n              (transported_compost ?bin))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Actions:\n\n1. **`use_as_cleaning_container`**: This action captures the intent of designating a container for compost material storage and making it accessible by moving it from the cabinet to the countertop. The state of the container changes from `in_cabinet` and `empty` to `on_countertop` and `designated_cleaning_container`.\n\n2. **`in_container`**: This action ensures the container remains in an easily accessible place, encouraging its use. The container's state transitions to `accessible` and `encourages_use`.\n\n3. **`make_collection`**: This action introduces an NPC (helper) to assist with the collection process, making it more efficient. The NPC's state changes from `visible` to `assists_collection`, and the location becomes `collection_ready`.\n\n4. **`keep_ingredients_in_container`**: This action ensures that baking soda is placed next to the kitchen compost bin for convenience. The baking soda's state transitions to `next_to_bin` and `ready_for_use`.\n\n5. **`get_to_compost_bin`**: This action represents the final step of transporting the compost materials to the compost bin. The container's state changes from `not (empty)` to `empty`, while the bin's state changes from `empty` to `full`. The action also indicates that the compost has been successfully transported.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The steps have been adjusted to align with the task's purpose and descriptions.\n- The entity states (e.g., `empty`, `full`, `accessible`, `designated_cleaning_container`) have been carefully chosen to reflect the state transitions relevant to the task.\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps were either omitted or modified to fit the task's context. For example, \"make_collection\" was interpreted as involving an NPC to assist with the collection process as a practical addition to the task.\n(:action save-shelter\n    :parameters (?npc - entity ?scraps - vegetable_kitchen_scraps)\n    :precondition (and (scraps_available ?scraps) (not (inTumbler ?scraps)))\n    :effect (and (saved ?scraps) (not (discarded ?scraps)))\n)\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The container must be empty, and the twigs are removed from the player's inventory.\n2. **`lay_material`**: Represents laying nitrogen-rich material on top of the twigs.\n3. **`alternate_layers`**: Alternates layers of carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich material. This assumes the player alternates materials in the container.\n4. **`spray_water`**: Represents spraying water into the container to moisten the compost layers.\n5. **`keep_bin`**: Places the compost bin in a location with sunlight to ensure proper decomposition.\n6. **`turn_compost`**: Represents the action of turning the compost weekly to aerate it.\n7. **`wait_two_months`**: Represents waiting for two months to allow the compost to fully decompose.\n8. **`start_fire`**: Represents starting a fire using wood and a drill (used for other processes if necessary).\n9. **`sliplargerbamboo_container`**: Represents slipping water into a container, assuming bamboo containers are used.\n10. **`turn_on_oven`**: Represents turning on an oven, though this action seems less relevant to the composting task but is included for completeness.\n\n### Adjustments:\n- Actions irrelevant to adding nitrogen to compost were modified or adjusted to fit the task.\n- Focused on entity states such as `wet`, `in_sun`, `layer_added`, and `compost_ready` to represent the progression of the composting process.\n- Added logical preconditions and effects to ensure actions align with the task flow.\n\n\n(:action make_collection\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (visible ?npc)\n                    (present ?location))\n    :effect (and\n              (assists_collection ?npc)\n              (collection_ready ?location))\n)\n\n;; Action 4: Keep baking soda next to the kitchen compost bin\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The seaweed is added to the NPC's inventory, and it is no longer available at the location.\n\n2. **wash_sand**: This action ensures that the seaweed is cleaned of sand and beach debris. The precondition checks if the NPC has the seaweed in inventory and is at a location where washing can occur (e.g., beach). The effect is that the seaweed becomes clean.\n\n3. **choose_use**: The NPC decides on the intended use for the seaweed (e.g., composting, liquid fertilizer, or direct application). The precondition ensures the use type is available, and the effect records the choice.\n\n4. **mix_materials**: Alice mixes the seaweed with other materials in a container. The precondition ensures that Alice has the seaweed and other materials in her inventory and that the container is empty. The effect is that the seaweed and materials are mixed in the container.\n\n5. **put_sealed**: This action involves sealing the container (e.g., for liquid fertilizer) and storing it. The precondition ensures that the container is already mixed and sealed. The effect is that the container is stored with the NPC.\n\n6. **use_seaweed**: The NPC applies the cleaned seaweed directly to a garden or other location. The precondition ensures the seaweed is clean and in the NPC's inventory. The effect is that the seaweed is applied to the location and removed from the inventory.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Relevance:\n- The step **choose_wailmer** was modified to **choose_use** to make it relevant to the context of deciding how to use seaweed (e.g., composting, liquid fertilizer, or direct application).\n- The entity states focus on transitions such as `inventory`, `clean`, `mixed`, `sealed`, and `applied`, which are necessary for the described task.\n- Descriptions were used to infer the logic behind each step and ensure the actions align with the task's intent.\n\n\n(:action use_as_cleaning_container\n    :parameters (?container - container)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (in_cabinet ?container)\n                    (empty ?container))\n    :effect (and\n              (on_countertop ?container)\n              (designated_cleaning_container ?container))\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Keep the container in an easily accessible place (e.g., on the countertop)\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

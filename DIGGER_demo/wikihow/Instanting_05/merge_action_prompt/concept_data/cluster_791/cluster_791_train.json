The area is marked as \"prepared\" after this action.\n2. **`melt_wax`**: Melts wax in a melting device (e.g., double boiler). The wax transitions from a solid to a melted state.\n3. **`pour_wax_into_pan`**: Pours melted wax into a pan or mold. The pan transitions from \"empty\" to \"not empty.\"\n4. **`remove_from_mixture`**: Removes wax cubes from the mixture once they have hardened. The cubes are removed from the pan.\n5. **`wick_mold`**: Places and centers the wick in the mold. The wick's state changes to \"centered.\"\n6. **`melt_smaller_wax_batch`**: Melts a smaller batch of wax for filling the mold. Similar to the `melt_wax` action.\n7. **`add_ingredients`**: Adds additives to the wax mixture. The mixture transitions to a \"mixed\" state.\n8. **`add_scenting_sauce`**: Adds scenting sauce to the mixture, making it \"scented.\"\n9. **`pour_wax_into_mold`**: Pours the liquid wax into the mold. The mold transitions from \"empty\" to \"not empty.\"\n10. **`apply_dye_to_candle`**: Applies dye to the candle for a tye-dye effect. The candle becomes \"dyed.\"\n11. **`freeze_candle`**: Places the candle in the freezer to harden. The candle transitions to a \"frozen\" state.\n12. **`remove_candle_from_mold`**: Removes the hardened candle from the mold. The candle is \"removed\" from the mold.\n13. **`make_drill`**: Creates a drill using wood. This action is included based on the step \"make_drill npc wood drill.\"\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Justifications:\n\n- **Irrelevant Steps**: Steps such as `(in_machine wick1)` and `(center_of_mixture w1)` were excluded as they did not align with the task description or logic.\n- **Entity-State Transitions**: Each action focuses on specific state transitions, such as \"melted,\" \"centered,\" \"dyed,\" etc., to reflect the described steps accurately.\n- **Task-Specific Logic**: The actions were tailored to the candle-making process, ensuring the entity states and transitions are relevant to the task.\n\nThis set of PDDL actions captures the intent, logic, and entity-state changes required for the \"How to Make a Tye Dye Candle\" task.\n(:action make_slip_larger_beads\n    :parameters (?npc - player ?beads - material)\n    :precondition (and (has_material ?npc ?beads) (not (slipped ?beads)))\n    :effect (and (slipped ?beads))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Actions\n1. **`break_paraffin`**: Represents breaking up the paraffin into smaller pieces.\n2. **`set_double_boiled_with_heat`**: Sets up the double boiler on the stove and activates the heat.\n3. **`set_burner_add_wicks`**: Places wicks on the burner for preparation.\n4. **`add_ingredient`**: Adds wax and crayon (or dye) into the container for melting.\n5. **`stir_with_wand`**: Stirs the melted wax using a wand for even mixing.\n6. **`mix_ingredients`**: Mixes additional ingredients (e.g., fragrance) into the wax using a wand.\n7. **`free_tart_papyrus`**: Prepares tart papyrus and places it into tins for molding.\n8. **`cut_wick`**: Cuts the wick to the appropriate size for the mold.\n9. **`wrap_wick_with_ink`**: Wraps the wick around a pencil for placement in the mold.\n10. **`pour_wax_into_mixture`**: Pours the melted wax mixture into the prepared molds with the wick.\n11. **`set_wicks_to_cool`**: Allows the wax and wick to cool and solidify.\n12. **`tape_papyrus`**: Tapes the papyrus to the tarts for decoration or packaging.\n13. **`make_slip_larger_beads`**: Finalizes the process by slipping larger beads for aesthetic or functional purposes.\n\nEach action reflects the state changes in the entities involved and adheres to the task's logical flow. If a step was irrelevant or unclear, it was modified to align with the task description.\n(:action cook-candles\n    :parameters (?npc - entity ?kitchen - entity)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at-location ?npc in-storage)\n      (at-cleanness ?kitchen clean)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (at-location ?npc in-kitchen)\n      (at-cleanness ?kitchen messy)\n    )\n)\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The state of the candle changes to `in the oven`.\n\n4. **put_ingredients_in_oven**: Moves the baking sheet with the candles into the oven. The state of the baking sheet changes to `in the oven`.\n\n5. **pull_baking_sheet**: Removes the baking sheet from the oven after the wax has melted. The state of the baking sheet changes to `on the table`.\n\n6. **take_jars_off_sheet**: Removes the candle jars from the baking sheet. The state of the jars changes to `on the table`.\n\n7. **wipe_mixture_with_paper**: Cleans the melted wax off the jars using a paper towel. The state of the jars changes from `has melted wax` to `clean`, and the towel becomes `dirty`.\n\n8. **reuse_mixture_container**: Marks the cleaned jar as reusable for other purposes. The state of the jar changes to `reusable`.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments to Steps:\n- The step \"put_ingredients_in_oven stove_knob velveeta\" was modified to \"put_ingredients_in_oven\" to align with the task's focus on placing the baking sheet into the oven.\n- The step \"wipe_mixture_with_paper towel1 container1\" was adjusted to focus on cleaning the jars using a paper towel.\n- Entity attributes such as `has_melted_wax`, `clean`, `dirty`, and `reusable` were added to reflect the relevant state transitions.\n\nThis set of PDDL actions captures the logic and state changes required to complete the task.\nThe actions after the merger are:",
    "\nYou're a professional AI, and you're able to combine multiple PDDL actions into one universal action. The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:practice\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action practice_with_equipment\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?c - candle ?w - wick)\n    :precondition (and (extinguished ?c) (burned_wick ?w))\n    :effect (and\n        (practiced ?npc)\n        (not (unpracticed ?npc))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **`light_candle`**:\n   - **Parameters**: The user (`?u`) and the candle (`?c`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The candle is not lit (`not (lit ?c)`), and the user has a match (`has_match ?u`).\n   - **Effects**: The candle becomes lit (`lit ?c`), and it is no longer unlit (`not (unlit ?c)`).\n\n2. **`lick_fingers`**:\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC (`?npc`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The NPC is visible (`visible ?npc`) and their fingers are not wet (`not (wet_fingers ?npc)`).\n   - **Effects**: The NPC's fingers become wet (`wet_fingers ?npc`), and they are no longer dry (`not (dry_fingers ?npc)`).\n\n3. **`place_hand_near_flame`**:\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC (`?npc`) and the candle (`?c`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The candle is lit (`lit ?c`), the NPC has wet fingers (`wet_fingers ?npc`), and their hand is not already near the flame (`not (hand_near_flame ?npc)`).\n   - **Effects**: The NPC places their hand near the flame (`hand_near_flame ?npc`).\n\n4. **`grab_wick`**:\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC (`?npc`), the wick (`?w`), and the candle (`?c`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The candle is lit (`lit ?c`), the NPC's hand is near the flame (`hand_near_flame ?npc`), their fingers are wet (`wet_fingers ?npc`), and the candle is not yet extinguished (`not (extinguished ?c)`).\n   - **Effects**: The candle becomes extinguished (`extinguished ?c`), it is no longer lit (`not (lit ?c)`), and the wick is marked as burned (`burned_wick ?w`).\n\n5. **`practice_with_equipment`**:\n   - **Parameters**: The NPC (`?npc`), the candle (`?c`), and the wick (`?w`).\n   - **Preconditions**: The candle has been extinguished (`extinguished ?c`), and the wick is burned (`burned_wick ?w`).\n   - **Effects**: The NPC practices the technique (`practiced ?npc`), and they are no longer unpracticed (`not (unpracticed ?npc)`).\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments to the Task:\n- The original step \"practice_with_equipment\" was interpreted as practicing the technique after extinguishing the candle. This action was made relevant and included as the final step.\n- The entity states were carefully considered, such as the candle transitioning from lit to extinguished, the NPC's fingers transitioning from dry to wet, and the wick being burned.\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the intent and logic of the task while focusing on the state changes of the entities involved.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

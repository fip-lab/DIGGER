The shrub's state changes from `in_container` to `removed`.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. `prepare_roots`\n```lisp\n\n(:action remove_topsoil\n    :parameters (?p - player ?fir - tree ?soil - soil ?container - container ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?fir ?loc) (wet ?soil) (not (exposed_roots ?fir)))\n    :effect (and (exposed_roots ?fir) (not (wet ?soil)))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Action: remove_tinder**\nRemove tinder (loose debris or small roots) from the surrounding area.\n```pddl\n\n(:action remove_tinder\n    :parameters (?p - player ?path - path ?tinder - tinder)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?path) (not (cleared ?path)))\n    :effect (and (cleared ?path) (inventory ?p ?tinder))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Action: dig_roots**\nDig out the roots of the tree using a spade.\n```pddl\n\n(:action remove_stake\n    :parameters (?person - alice ?stake - oak_log)\n    :precondition (and (at ?person ?stake) (staked ?stake))\n    :effect (and (not (staked ?stake)) (inventory ?person ?stake))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **`unpack_bare_branch`**:\n   - Represents unpacking the bare root tree from the container it came in. The tree is now in the NPC's inventory.\n\n2. **`set_tree`**:\n   - The tree is placed into a bucket filled with water, making it wet and no longer in the NPC's inventory.\n\n3. **`dig_hole`**:\n   - A hole is dug at the path location, enabling the planting process. The path transitions to a \"dug\" state.\n\n4. **`check_soil`**:\n   - The soil in the dug hole is checked for weed roots. The path transitions to an \"investigated\" state.\n\n5. **`plant_tinder`**:\n   - The tree (tinder) is planted in the hole, completing the planting process.\n\n6. **`peel_dirt`**:\n   - Represents removing excess dirt from the planting area.\n\n7. **`build_water_basin`**:\n   - A water basin is built around the tree's location to retain water.\n\n8. **`add_area`**:\n   - Mulch is added to the area around the tree, improving soil quality and moisture retention.\n\n9. **`drink_water`**:\n   - The NPC drinks water from the bucket, transitioning the NPC to a \"hydrated\" state and reducing the water level in the bucket.\n\n10. **`stake_oak`**:\n    - A stake is placed to support the tree. The log transitions from \"inventory\" to \"staked.\"\n\n11. **`remove_stake`**:\n    - The stake is removed after a year, transitioning the stake back to the inventory.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments:\n- Some steps were clarified or modified (e.g., \"remove-stake alice\" was interpreted as removing the stake after a year).\n- Task-specific states such as `wet`, `dug`, `staked`, `hydrated`, and `mulch_added` were introduced to capture the logical transitions.\n\nThis PDDL model ensures that the task steps are faithfully represented while maintaining logical consistency and state tracking.\n(:action remove_binding\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?plant - plant)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?plant) (tied ?plant) (healed ?plant))\n    :effect (and (not (tied ?plant)))\n)\n\n\n(:action remove_branch\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?path - location ?rootstock - plant)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?path) (cut_branch ?rootstock) (new_leaves_grown ?rootstock))\n    :effect (and (removed_branch ?rootstock)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **plant_plant**: Plants the rootstock plant into a container. Preconditions ensure the container is empty, and the plant is not already planted. The effect marks the plant as planted and the container as containing the plant.\n\n2. **graft_plant**: Grafts the plant at a specific location when the plant is budding. The effect marks the plant as grafted and no longer budding.\n\n3. **make_cut**: Makes a T-shaped cut on the rootstock plant. Preconditions ensure the plant is planted and not already cut. The effect marks the plant as having a T-cut.\n\n4. **cut_buds**: Cuts a healthy bud and attached wood from the scion plant at the nursery. Preconditions ensure healthy buds are available. The effect gives the NPC the bud wood.\n\n5. **insert_bamboo_log**: Inserts the bud wood into the T-cut on the rootstock plant. Preconditions ensure the NPC has the bud wood and the rootstock has a T-cut. The effect marks the rootstock as grafted with the bud.\n\n6. **tie_plant**: Ties the grafted plant to secure the bud wood. Preconditions ensure the plant has a grafted bud and is not already tied. The effect marks the plant as tied.\n\n7. **remove_binding**: Removes the binding after the grafted plant has healed. Preconditions ensure the plant is tied and healed. The effect removes the tied state.\n\n8. **cut_branch**: Cuts the rootstock branch above the new bud after grafting. Preconditions ensure the rootstock has a grafted bud and the branch is not already cut. The effect marks the branch as cut.\n\n9. **remove_branch**: Removes the rest of the rootstock branch after the bud wood has grown new leaves. Preconditions ensure the branch is cut and new leaves have grown. The effect marks the branch as removed.\n\nThese actions reflect the logical sequence of steps and state changes required to graft plants, adhering to the PDDL format. Each action's preconditions and effects are carefully crafted to capture the transitions in the entity states.\n(:action peel\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?clifftop - clifftop)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?npc ?clifftop) (straight ?clifftop))\n    :effect (twisted ?clifftop)\n)\n\n\n(:action peel_dirt\n    :parameters (?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?npc ?tinder))\n    :effect (and (not (inventory ?npc ?tinder)) (dirt_removed))\n)\n\n\n(:action prune_stalks\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?nursery - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?nursery) (harvested ?nursery))\n    :effect (and (pruned ?nursery) (not (overgrown ?nursery)))\n)\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The state of the soil changes from `dry` to `wet`.\n2. **remove_topsoil**: This action involves removing the topsoil to expose the roots. The state of the tree changes to `exposed_roots`, and the soil is no longer wet.\n3. **remove_tinder**: This action clears the surrounding area of small debris or loose material (tinder). The path state changes to `cleared`, and the player collects the tinder.\n4. **dig_roots**: This action involves digging out the roots of the tree. The state of the tree changes to `roots_removed`, and the root ball becomes `partially_exposed`.\n5. **dig_root_ball**: This action removes the root ball from the ground.

The state of the plant changes from being in the player's inventory to being inside the container.\n\n2. **`harden_plant`**: Hardens the plant to prepare it for outdoor conditions. The state of the plant changes to \"hardened.\"\n\n3. **`plan_transplant`**: Ensures that the NPC plans the transplant during the cool part of the day. This action sets the state of the transplant plan as \"ready.\"\n\n4. **`fill_planted_soil`**: Fills the container with gardening soil. The container's state changes from \"empty\" to \"filled_with_soil.\"\n\n5. **`dip_pot`**: Places the plant into a pot. The pot becomes dirty as a result of the action.\n\n6. **`slide_pot_out`**: Slides the root ball out of the container. The root ball is now in the player's inventory and no longer inside the container.\n\n7. **`peel`**: Twists the clifftop into a new shape, as per the task description. This action may be tangential but included for completeness.\n\n8. **`loosen_tinder`**: Loosens the root ball to prepare it for planting. The root ball's state changes from \"intact\" to \"loosened.\"\n\n9. **`place_root_ball_into_hole`**: Places the loosened root ball into the prepared hole. The state of the root ball changes to \"in_hole.\"\n\n10. **`fill`**: Fills the space around the root ball with soil from the soil container. The soil container's state changes to \"empty,\" and the hole is now \"filled.\"\n\n11. **`wet_plant`**: Waters the plant thoroughly after transplantation. The plant's state changes to \"watered,\" and the container becomes \"wet.\"\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- The actions are structured to reflect the logical sequence of the task.\n- Preconditions and effects ensure that the state transitions align with the task's requirements.\n- Irrelevant steps or unclear descriptions were adjusted or excluded to maintain relevance to the task.

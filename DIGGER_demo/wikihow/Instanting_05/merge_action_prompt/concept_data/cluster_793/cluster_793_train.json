The state of the bowl changes from `empty` to `not empty`, and the lemon salt changes from `separate` to `mixed`.\n\n2. **`place-lemon-juice-on-stove`**: Represents placing the mixed lemon juice and salt on the stove and turning it on. The stove state transitions from `off` to `on`, and the lemon salt begins heating.\n\n3. **`scrape-off-crust`**: Reflects scraping the crust off the heated mixture using a spoon. The crust transitions from `heated` to `scraped`.\n\n4. **`place-crust-in-bowl`**: Represents placing the scraped crust into a clean bowl.

The crust transitions from `wet` to `dry`.\n\n8. **`put-crust-in-container`**: Represents storing the dry crust in a container. The container transitions from `empty` to `stored`.\n\n9. **`eat-cheese`**: Represents eating cheese by the NPC. The cheese transitions from `edible` to `eaten`.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Clarifications:\n\n- **Irrelevant or unclear steps** like \"keep_process going\" were adapted to make sense in the context of continuing the boiling process.\n- **Entity states** have been carefully chosen to reflect the transitions described in the task (e.g., `wet` to `dry`, `empty` to `not empty`).\n- Actions like \"boil-water\" and \"drain-lemon\" were added to ensure logical continuity of the task.\n\nThis ensures the generated PDDL actions accurately capture the task and its entity state transitions.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The precondition checks that the bag is available in the store, and the effect updates its state to be in possession and no longer available in the store.\n\n2. **dissolve-salt**: Represents dissolving the salt into a bag/container. The precondition checks that the salt bag is in possession and the container is empty. The effect updates the state of the salt to dissolved and moves it into the container.\n\n3. **add-ingredient**: Represents adding food coloring to the container. The precondition ensures the container has dissolved salt, and the food coloring is available. The effect mixes the food coloring with the salt and colors the container.\n\n4. **zip-bag**: Represents zipping the bag after adding food coloring. The precondition ensures the container is open and colored. The effect closes the bag and shakes it.\n\n5. **add-more-ingredient**: Represents adding more food coloring to the bag if desired. The precondition ensures the bag is closed and shaken. The effect updates the state to indicate the bag is more colored.\n\n6. **open-bag**: Represents opening the bag after shaking it. The precondition ensures the bag is closed and colored. The effect updates the state to open.\n\n7. **let-salt-dry**: Represents letting the colored salt dry. The precondition ensures the bag is open and colored. The effect updates the state to dry.\n\n8. **play-with-sand**: Represents playing with the colored sand at the beach. The precondition ensures the sand is dry and the NPC is available. The effect updates the state to show the NPC is engaged and the beach is used.\n\n### Adjustments:\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps (e.g., \"add-ingredient food_colors alice\") were refined to align with the task.\n- The state transitions for entities like `bag`, `food_colors`, and `npc` were carefully mapped to reflect the described actions accurately.\n- The state of the `beach` was incorporated to represent the final play activity.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

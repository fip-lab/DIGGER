These steps were modified to reflect the actual task requirements:\n  - `free_wicks` was interpreted as \"freeze the dripped wax.\"\n  - `scrash-wicks` was corrected to \"scrape the frozen wax.\"\n  - `remove_wicks` was interpreted as \"remove the wax using heat.\"\n- Entity attributes for wax (`frozen`, `scraped`, `removed`) and heat source (`powered_on`) were incorporated to reflect the state transitions relevant to the task.\n\n---\n\nThis set of PDDL actions captures the logical flow of the task and ensures that the entity state transitions (e.g., wax becoming frozen, scraped, and removed) are accurately represented.\n(:action remove_wicks\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?b - paperbag)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (wax_remaining ?n)\n                    (clean_bag ?b)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (wax_transferred_to_bag ?b)\n              (not (wax_remaining ?n))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **Action 1: Place Plain Paper Bag**  \n   - **Parameters**: A passenger (`?p`) and a paper bag (`?b`).\n   - **Precondition**: Wax spill exists in the area (`wax_spill_area ?p`), and the paper bag is not already covering the wax (`not (covering_wax ?b)`).\n   - **Effect**: The paper bag covers the wax (`covering_wax ?b`), and the wax spill area is no longer exposed (`not (wax_spill_area ?p)`).\n\n2. **Action 2: Run Iron Over Bag**  \n   - **Parameters**: An NPC (`?n`) and a paper bag (`?b`).\n   - **Precondition**: The paper bag is covering the wax (`covering_wax ?b`), the iron is ready (`iron_ready ?n`), and the iron is set to medium heat (`heat_medium ?n`).\n   - **Effect**: The wax is transferred to the paper bag (`wax_transferred_to_bag ?b`), and the paper bag is no longer covering the wax (`not (covering_wax ?b)`).\n\n3. **Action 3: Remove Paper Bag**  \n   - **Parameters**: A bag (`?b`).\n   - **Precondition**: The wax has been transferred to the paper bag (`wax_transferred_to_bag ?b`).\n   - **Effect**: The bag is removed (`bag_removed ?b`), and it no longer contains transferred wax (`not (wax_transferred_to_bag ?b)`).\n\n4. **Action 4: Repeat with Clean Paper Bags**  \n   - **Parameters**: An NPC (`?n`) and a clean paper bag (`?b`).\n   - **Precondition**: Wax remains on the surface (`wax_remaining ?n`), and a clean paper bag is available (`clean_bag ?b`).\n   - **Effect**: The wax is transferred to the clean paper bag (`wax_transferred_to_bag ?b`), and the surface no longer has remaining wax (`not (wax_remaining ?n)`).\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The original steps were slightly unclear or irrelevant (e.g., \"passenger1\" and \"npc\" roles were not directly explained). Adjustments were made to ensure the task aligns with removing wax from wool using paper bags and an iron.\n- The state transitions focus on the wax's location (e.g., from the wool to the paper bag) and the state of the paper bag (e.g., clean vs. used).\n- Repetition of the process until the wax is fully removed is captured in **Action 4**.\n\nThis PDDL representation ensures clarity and logical consistency for the task.\n(:action remove_ganda_beroza\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?ganda_beroza - ganda_beroza)\n    :precondition (and (ganda_effect_applied ?npc))\n    :effect (and (not (ganda_effect_applied ?npc)) (ganda_removed ?npc ?ganda_beroza))\n)\n\n\n(:action remove_paper_bag\n    :parameters (?b - bag)\n    :precondition (wax_transferred_to_bag ?b)\n    :effect (and\n              (bag_removed ?b)\n              (not (wax_transferred_to_bag ?b))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 4: Repeat with Clean Paper Bags\n```lisp\n\n(:action clean_shelter ; Ensure the area is clean and ready\n    :parameters (?p - player ?l - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?l) (clean ?l))\n    :effect (prepared ?l)\n)\n\n\n(:action clean_skin\n    :parameters (?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (and (wailmer_removed ?npc))\n    :effect (and (clean_skin ?npc))\n)\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:CheckAppointment\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action CheckAppointment\n    :parameters (?npc - person)\n    :precondition (appointment_made ?npc)\n    :effect (appointment_checked ?npc)\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **SearchForLegWax**\n   - **Action Name:** `SearchForLegWax`\n   - **Parameters:** \n     - `?npc` - the person performing the search.\n     - `?location` - the place where the search is conducted (e.g., basement, online, etc.).\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - The person (`?npc`) has not already searched for leg wax services (`not (searched_for_leg_wax ?npc)`).\n     - The person is located in the specified location (`located_in ?npc ?location`).\n   - **Effect:** \n     - The person has searched for leg wax services (`searched_for_leg_wax ?npc`).\n\n2. **MakeAppointment**\n   - **Action Name:** `MakeAppointment`\n   - **Parameters:** \n     - `?npc` - the person making the appointment.\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - The person has not yet made an appointment (`not (appointment_made ?npc)`).\n   - **Effect:** \n     - The person has successfully made an appointment (`appointment_made ?npc`).\n\n3. **CheckAppointment**\n   - **Action Name:** `CheckAppointment`\n   - **Parameters:** \n     - `?npc` - the person checking the appointment.\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - The person has already made an appointment (`appointment_made ?npc`).\n   - **Effect:** \n     - The person has checked and confirmed their appointment (`appointment_checked ?npc`).\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n1. **Irrelevant Steps:** The provided steps mention `npc basement`, which seems unrelated to the task of waxing legs. These were adjusted to focus on the logical progression of finding leg wax services, making an appointment, and attending the appointment.\n2. **Entity States:** For this task, the relevant entity states were:\n   - **Person (`npc`)**: States include whether they have searched for leg wax services, made an appointment, or checked the appointment.\n   - **Location (`basement`)**: The basement entity was not directly relevant to the task and was excluded in the final PDDL actions.\n3. **Task-Specific Adjustments:** Steps were modified to align with the logical flow of the task: search for services, make an appointment, and check the appointment.\n\nIf you have additional clarifications or require further refinements, feel free to ask!\nThe actions after the merger are:"

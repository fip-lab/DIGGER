The irrelevant or unclear steps were omitted or modified to ensure logical consistency.\n- The entity state transitions were carefully modeled to reflect the changes in the blender and peanut butter during each action.\n- The preconditions and effects ensure that the task progresses logically, maintaining consistency with the described process.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The preconditions ensure the ingredients are separate and the bowl is empty. The effects show the ingredients are now in the bowl and no longer separate.\n\n2. **`put-ingredients-in-container`**: This action transfers the cream from the bowl into the container. The container must be empty and sealed, and the cream is no longer in the bowl after this action.\n\n3. **`start-shaking-container`**: This action starts shaking the sealed container. The precondition ensures the container is sealed and contains cream. The effect indicates the container is now being shaken.\n\n4. **`add-salt-to-cream`**: This action adds salt to the cream after it has thickened. The precondition ensures the cream is thickened and salt is available. The effect indicates the cream is now salted.\n\n5. **`continue-shaking-container`**: This action continues shaking the container after salt is added. The effect shows that butter is formed, and the liquid is separated.\n\n6. **`place-paper-towel-over-cup`**: This action prepares the cup for draining by placing a clean paper towel over it. The precondition ensures the towel is clean and the cup is empty.\n\n7. **`drain-liquid`**: This action drains the liquid from the container into the cup using the paper towel. The effects show that the liquid is in the cup and butter is left in the towel.\n\n8. **`remove-butter-from-towel`**: This action removes the butter from the paper towel. The precondition ensures the butter is in the towel and clean. The effect indicates the butter is removed.\n\n9. **`knead-butter`**: This action kneads the butter in a mixing bowl. The precondition ensures the butter is removed from the towel and clean. The effect shows the butter is kneaded and in the bowl.\n\n10. **`add-salt-to-butter`**: This action adds salt to the kneaded butter. The precondition ensures the butter is kneaded and salt is available. The effect shows the butter is now salted.\n\n11. **`let-butter-set`**: This action lets the butter set on a cooling surface. The precondition ensures the butter is salted and there is a cooling surface available. The effect shows the butter is set and on the surface.\n\nThese actions reflect the logical flow of the task while capturing the relevant state transitions for the entities involved.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

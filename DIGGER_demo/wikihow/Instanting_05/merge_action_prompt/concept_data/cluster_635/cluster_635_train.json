The `whole` attribute changes to `in_pieces`, and the steak becomes `exposed`.\n\n2. **`check_doneness`**:\n   - This action involves checking the doneness of the steak, which requires it to be cooked. The state `doneness_checked` is added to indicate this step is completed.\n\n3. **`check_meat`**:\n   - This action assesses the firmness of the steak by comparing it to parts of the face. The state `firmness_checked` is added to track this step.\n\n4. **`make_signal`**:\n   - This action represents an NPC signaling the steak's doneness. The NPC must be visible, and the state `signal_made` is added to indicate the completion of this step. Additionally, the NPC becomes invisible after signaling.\n\n### Entity State Transitions:\n- **Steak**:\n  - `whole` \u2192 `in_pieces`\n  - `exposed` \u2192 `doneness_checked`\n  - `doneness_checked` \u2192 `firmness_checked`\n\n- **NPC**:\n  - `visible` \u2192 `signal_made` \u2192 `invisible`\n\nThis set of actions accurately reflects the task steps and captures the relevant state changes for the steak and the NPC.\n(:action make_grilling_marinade\n    :parameters (?p - player ?stove - stove_knob ?v - velveeta)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?stove) (at ?v ?stove) (temperature ?stove cool) (granularity ?v solid))\n    :effect (and (temperature ?stove hot) (granularity ?v liquid) (marinade_prepared ?p))\n)\n```\n\n#### 2. **make_dry_rub**\n```lisp\n\n(:action make_dry_rub\n    :parameters (?p - player ?a - alice)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?a) (step ?a unselected))\n    :effect (and (step ?a selected) (dry_rub_prepared ?p))\n)\n```\n\n#### 3. **make_herbed_ingredients**\n```lisp\n\n(:action make_herbed_ingredients\n    :parameters (?p - player ?stove - stove_knob ?v - velveeta)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?stove) (at ?v ?stove) (temperature ?stove hot) (granularity ?v liquid))\n    :effect (and (herbed_butter_prepared ?p))\n)\n```\n\n#### 4. **chop_asparagus**\n```lisp\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The preconditions ensure the steak is plain and in the fridge, and the marinade is in a bottle. After the action, the steak becomes marinated and is placed in a bowl with the marinade.\n\n2. **Step 2 (Mix garlic and herb marinade)**: The action `mix_flavor` involves mixing garlic and herbs in a bowl to create a marinade. The preconditions ensure the garlic and herbs are in the pantry and separated. After the action, they are blended together in the bowl.\n\n3. **Step 3 (Cook steak on the grill)**: The action `cook_steak` represents grilling the marinated steak. The preconditions ensure the steak is marinated and the grill is off and cold. After the action, the steak is cooked on the grill, and the grill is hot and powered on.\n\n4. **Step 4 (Serve steak with sides)**: The action `serve_steak` involves serving the cooked steak with grilled vegetables and chimichurri on a plate. The preconditions ensure all components are prepared and in their respective locations. After the action, the steak, vegetables, and chimichurri are on the plate, which is marked as served.\n\n---\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the logical flow of the task, focusing on the state changes of the entities involved.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

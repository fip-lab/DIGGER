Ensures the potato and mixing bowl are clean and properly located.\n2. **`use_full_of_milk`**: Adds full-fat milk and butter to the mixing bowl. This step ensures the mixture is ready for mashing.\n3. **`peel_potatoes`**: Peels the potato, changing its composition state from \"whole\" to \"peeled.\"\n4. **`boil_potatoes`**: Boils the potato in a pot on a heated stove, changing its composition state from \"raw\" to \"cooked.\"\n5. **`mash_mixture`**: Mashes the mixture in the mixing bowl, incorporating canola oil and cluttering the table.\n6. **`cool_potatoes`**: Cools the mashed potatoes thoroughly by placing them in the oven, changing their state to \"cooled.\"\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made\n- The step \"boil_wicks wick1\" was irrelevant to the task and replaced with \"boil_potatoes.\"\n- The entity states and attributes for each object were carefully considered to align with the task description.\n- The actions reflect the logical sequence of preparing mashed potatoes for freezing.\n\n\n(:action cool_meatballs\n    :parameters (?p - person ?meatballs - food ?plate - container)\n    :precondition (and\n        (owned ?p ?meatballs) (cooked ?meatballs) (hot ?meatballs)\n        (owned ?p ?plate) (clean ?plate) (at ?plate kitchen_counter1)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (cool ?meatballs)\n        (at ?meatballs ?plate)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 3: Freeze Meatballs\n```lisp\n\n(:action reheat_meatballs\n    :parameters (?p - person ?meatballs - food ?microwave - appliance)\n    :precondition (and\n        (owned ?p ?meatballs) (frozen ?meatballs) (at ?meatballs freezer_location)\n        (owned ?p ?microwave) (at ?microwave kitchen_counter1) (on ?microwave)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (reheated ?meatballs)\n        (hot ?meatballs)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Explanations:\n1. **Cook Meatballs**:\n   - The step \"cook_meatballs velveeta\" was clarified to involve cooking the meatballs in a pan on a stove. The state of the meatballs changes from `(raw)` to `(cooked)` and `(hot)`.\n   - The pan becomes `(dirty)` after cooking.\n\n2. **Cool Meatballs**:\n   - Cooling the meatballs transitions their state from `(hot)` to `(cool)`. The meatballs are placed on a plate for cooling.\n\n3. **Freeze Meatballs**:\n   - The step \"free_meatballs velveeta\" was interpreted as freezing the meatballs. The state of the meatballs changes from `(cool)` to `(frozen)`, and they are placed in a freezer.\n\n4. **Reheat Meatballs**:\n   - The step \"cook npc\" seems irrelevant or misplaced, so it was modified to \"reheat meatballs.\" This step involves reheating the frozen meatballs using a microwave, transitioning their state from `(frozen)` to `(reheated)` and `(hot)`.\n\n5. **Entity States**:\n   - The state transitions for the meatballs (e.g., `(raw)` \u2192 `(cooked)` \u2192 `(cool)` \u2192 `(frozen)` \u2192 `(reheated)`) were carefully defined to reflect the task.\n   - The involvement of tools (e.g., pan, plate, freezer, microwave) and their states (e.g., `(clean)` or `(dirty)`) were also considered.\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the logical flow and state changes of the task \"How to Freeze Meatballs\" while ensuring that irrelevant or unclear steps are refined for clarity and relevance.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

This step was replaced with \"make_sour_milk_cheese,\" as making sour milk cheese aligns with the task description of treating hens.\n- The entity state transitions were designed to reflect the changes in location, state, and usage of the sour milk, hen feed, and cheese.\n- The actions were named concisely to accurately describe their function.\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the intent and logic of the task while adhering to the format and structure shown in the example.\n(:action cook_meatballs\n    :parameters (?p - person ?meatballs - food ?pan - container ?stove - appliance)\n    :precondition (and\n        (owned ?p ?meatballs) (at ?meatballs kitchen_counter1) (raw ?meatballs)\n        (owned ?p ?pan) (clean ?pan) (at ?pan stove_location)\n        (owned ?p ?stove) (on ?stove)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (cooked ?meatballs)\n        (hot ?meatballs)\n        (dirty ?pan)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 2: Cool Meatballs\n```lisp\n\n(:action turn_off_egg_boiler\n    :parameters (?user - person ?egg_boiler - appliance)\n    :precondition (and\n      (at ?user ?egg_boiler)\n      (used ?egg_boiler)\n      (on ?egg_boiler)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (not (on ?egg_boiler))\n      (off ?egg_boiler)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Changes to the Provided Steps\n\n1. **clean_eraser user1 eraser1**: This step was irrelevant to the task of using an egg boiler. It was modified to focus on cleaning the egg boiler's heating unit, as described in the task.\n\n2. **clean_oven npc**: This step was also irrelevant and was replaced with actions related to cleaning the egg boiler.\n\n3. **drink_water person water**: This step was unrelated to the task description and was replaced with the action of refilling the egg boiler with distilled water, as mentioned in the task description.\n\n---\n\n### Entity State Changes\n\n- **Egg Boiler**: \n  - `dirty` \u2192 `clean` (after cleaning)\n  - `empty` \u2192 `filled` (after refilling with water)\n  - `on` \u2192 `off` (after turning off)\n\n- **Water**:\n  - `distilled` is a required attribute for the water used in the egg boiler.\n\n- **Egg**:\n  - `not cooked` \u2192 `cooked` (after using the egg boiler)\n\n- **User**:\n  - Must be `at` the location of the egg boiler to perform actions.\n\n---\n\nThis set of PDDL actions captures the intent and logic of the task while focusing on the relevant entity state changes and ensuring alignment with the task description.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The action assumes the use of a machine or alternative cleaning method to clean the linen before bleaching.\n   - The state of the linen changes from `dirty` to `clean`.\n\n3. **Step: add_salt_and_ingredients**\n   - This step was modified to focus on heating and soaking the linen with salt and other ingredients on a stove, as described in the task.\n   - The action includes preconditions that the stove knob is `cool` and effects that it becomes `hot` and the linen becomes `soaked`.\n\n4. **Irrelevant or Misaligned Steps**\n   - Steps that were not directly relevant to the task were omitted or adjusted to better align with the intent of bleaching linen.\n\n---\n\nThese actions capture the essence of the task and reflect the state changes of the entities involved.

It changes the state of the bathtub from `empty` to `full` and the location of the water from `in_pipes` to `in_bathtub`.\n\n2. **mix_chlorine_blend**: This action involves mixing the chlorine blend into the bathtub. It changes the location of the chlorine blend from being `in_container` to `in_bathtub` and unseals the container.\n\n3. **soak_wicks**: This action represents the person soaking in the bathtub. It sets the state of the person as `soaking`.\n\n4. **clean_wicks**: After soaking, the person rinses off and becomes cleaner. The state of `soaking` is set to `false`, and the person's `cleanness` is updated to `cleaner`.\n\n5. **moisturize_body**: After the bath, the person moisturizes their body using lotion. This action updates the state of the person to `hydrated`.\n\n6. **blend_bath**: This final action represents the overall relaxation achieved after completing the bleach bath process. It sets the state of the person to `relaxed`.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The steps have been slightly adjusted to match the task's intent and descriptions.\n- Entity states such as `emptiness`, `location`, `soaking`, `cleanness`, `hydrated`, and `relaxed` are used to capture the transitions during the process.\n- The actions ensure logical progression and state changes that align with the task description.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

Instead, the focus was placed on the logical progression of bleaching skin with peroxide. \n\n### Entity States:\n- **Soap**: Tracks its state from \"whole\" to \"grated.\"\n- **Container**: Tracks its state as it transitions from empty to containing a mixture or paste.\n- **Skin (NPC)**: Tracks states such as \"clean_skin,\" \"paste_applied,\" \"paste_set,\" and \"light_skin.\"\n- **Tool**: Tracks its cleanliness during the process.\n- **Water**: Tracks availability for rinsing.\n\nThis representation ensures that the actions are aligned with the task's intent and entity state transitions.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

In such cases, I interpreted the action to fit the context of braiding or related tasks, ensuring the action remains meaningful.\n- The entity states focus on the transformation of hair (`natural_hair`, `braided`, `styled`) and the intermediate states of the braids (`wet`, `dry`).\n- The `npc` entity's attributes (e.g., `decoration`, `visibility`) were not directly relevant to the task and were therefore not explicitly included in the PDDL actions. However, they can be incorporated if additional context or requirements are provided.\n\nLet me know if you need further refinements or additional actions!\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The precondition ensures the cornrows are not yet on the strip and are in a random organization. The effect updates their location to be on the strip and their organization to be orderly (on a band).\n\n2. **create_unique_completed**:\n   - This action creates a unique and completed look for the cornrows. The precondition checks that the cornrows are loose and randomly composed. The effect transforms them into a banded shape with an orderly composition.\n\n3. **braid_cornrows**:\n   - This action braids the cornrows into a specific style (e.g., a high ponytail or zig-zag parts). The precondition checks that the NPC's decoration is plain, visibility is visible, and the cornrows are loose. The effect updates the NPC's decoration to camouflaged, visibility to invisible, and the cornrows' shape to banded.\n\n4. **choose_cornrows**:\n   - This action involves selecting a specific type of cornrows (e.g., side-swept, swirl, zig-zag). The precondition ensures the cornrows are off the strip and randomly organized. The effect updates their location to be on the strip and their organization to be orderly on the band.\n\n---\n\nThese actions reflect the intent and logic of the task while ensuring accurate state transitions for the entities involved (cornrows and NPC).\n(:action secure_ends\n    :parameters (?e - ends)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (organization separate ?e)\n                    (form bare ?e)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (organization touching ?e)\n              (not (organization separate ?e))\n              (form joined-together ?e)\n              (not (form bare ?e))\n            )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n1. **`braiding_with_wire`**:\n   - Focuses on the initial process of transforming the wire strands into a braided form.\n   - Changes the `decoration` attribute of the `npc` entity from `bare` to `camouflaged` and its `visibility` from `visible` to `invisible`.\n\n2. **`separate_weave`**:\n   - Represents the step of separating the strands of wire after braiding.\n   - Changes the `visibility` attribute of the `npc` entity from `invisible` back to `visible`.\n\n3. **`pull_twice`**:\n   - Simulates the process of pulling the wire strands twice, ensuring they are properly aligned and tightened.\n   - Re-camouflages the strands, keeping the `decoration` attribute as `camouflaged`.\n\n4. **`secure_ends`**:\n   - Represents the final step of securing the loose ends of the wire rope.\n   - Changes the `organization` attribute of the `ends` entity from `separate` to `touching` and the `form` attribute from `bare` to `joined-together`.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The `npc` entity represents the wire strands being braided, with attributes like `decoration` and `visibility` reflecting their state transitions during the process.\n- The `ends` entity represents the loose ends of the wire rope, with attributes like `organization` and `form` capturing their state changes during the securing process.\n- Each action is designed to reflect the logical flow of the task, ensuring that preconditions and effects align with the task description and entity state transitions.\n\nLet me know if further adjustments are needed!\n(:action secure_with_hair_elastic\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?e - elastic)\n    :precondition (and (braid_state ?n in_progress) (elastic_state ?e available))\n    :effect (and (braid_state ?n completed) (elastic_state ?e in_use) (hair_position ?n secured))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Actions:\n\n1. **sweep_all_of_hair**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?n` represents the person (npc) whose hair is being braided.\n   - **Preconditions**: The hair must initially be positioned at the back, and the npc's hands must be free to perform the action.\n   - **Effect**: The hair is now swept to the side, and the npc's hands are no longer free (because they are holding/manipulating the hair).\n\n2. **part_of_hair**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?n` represents the person (npc).\n   - **Preconditions**: The hair must already be swept to the side, and it must be unpartitioned (not divided into sections).\n   - **Effect**: The hair is now partitioned into two sections, ready for braiding.\n\n3. **start_braid**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?n` represents the person (npc).\n   - **Preconditions**: The hair must be partitioned into two sections, and the braid must not have been started yet.\n   - **Effect**: The braid is now in progress.\n\n4. **secure_with_hair_elastic**:\n   - **Parameters**: `?n` represents the person (npc), and `?e` represents the hair elastic.\n   - **Preconditions**: The braid must be in progress, and the hair elastic must be available for use.\n   - **Effect**: The braid is now completed, the hair elastic is in use (securing the braid), and the hair is secured in its final position.\n\n---\n\n### Entity State Transitions:\n- **npc (person)**:\n  - `hair_position`: Changes from `back` \u2192 `side` \u2192 `secured`.\n  - `hair_sections`: Changes from `unpartitioned` \u2192 `partitioned_into_two`.\n  - `braid_state`: Changes from `not_started` \u2192 `in_progress` \u2192 `completed`.\n\n- **elastic (hair elastic)**:\n  - `elastic_state`: Changes from `available` \u2192 `in_use`.\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the intent, logic, and state transitions of the task steps accurately.\n(:action secure_braid\n    :parameters (?b - braid1)\n    :precondition (and (shape ?b twisted_and_folded) (state ?b in_progress))\n    :effect (and (shape ?b finalized) (state ?b secured))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **brush_with_hair**:\n   - This action represents brushing your hair thoroughly to prepare for braiding.\n   - Preconditions: Hair must be unbrushed, and the person's focus must not yet be on braiding.\n   - Effects: Hair becomes brushed, and the person's focus shifts to braiding.\n\n2. **part_of_hair**:\n   - This action divides the hair into two sections, which is essential for starting the braid.\n   - Preconditions: Hair must be unpartitioned and visible.\n   - Effects: Hair becomes partitioned, and its visibility changes to camouflaged (as it is now styled/prepared).\n\n3. **start_braid**:\n   - This action initiates the braiding process after the hair has been parted.\n   - Preconditions: Hair must be partitioned and in a straight shape.\n   - Effects: Hair becomes partially braided, and its state changes to \"in progress.\"\n\n4. **make_sliplargerbeads**:\n   - This step involves decorating the hair during the braiding process.\n   - Preconditions: Hair must be plain (no decoration) and in progress (actively being braided).\n   - Effects: Hair becomes camouflaged (decorated), and its state changes to \"decorated.\"\n\n5. **braiding_with_hair**:\n   - This action ensures the equipment or tools used for braiding (e.g., combs, clips) are organized and ready.\n   - Preconditions: Equipment must be scattered and unorganized.\n   - Effects: Equipment becomes organized and laid in a pattern for easy use.\n\n6. **secure_braid**:\n   - This action secures the braid at the end with a hair elastic or similar item.\n   - Preconditions: The braid must be twisted and folded (braided) and still in progress.\n   - Effects: The braid becomes finalized and secured, completing the task.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- Some steps were clarified or slightly modified to fit the logic of the task (e.g., decorating the braid was inferred as part of \"make_sliplargerbeads\").\n- The entity states were carefully chosen to align with the task description, focusing on attributes such as \"shape,\" \"state,\" \"organization,\" and \"decoration.\"\n- Irrelevant or ambiguous steps were adjusted to ensure logical consistency.\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the intent, logic, and state transitions of the task effectively.\n(:action gather_hair\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?chunk - hair_chunk)\n    :precondition (and (hair_parted ?npc ?side) (chunk_unselected ?chunk))\n    :effect (and (chunk_selected ?chunk) (not (chunk_unselected ?chunk)))\n)\n\n\n(:action find-smallest-tubing\n    :parameters (?npc -

I have replaced it with `leather` as the primary entity.\n- The \"npc\" entity was not clearly tied to the task steps or description, so I excluded it from the actions. If it has a specific role (e.g., assisting with the task), it can be reintroduced with a more defined purpose.\n- The entity states focus on attributes relevant to the task, such as `braided`, `whole`, `completed`, and `used_as_ring`.\n\nThis ensures that the PDDL actions align with the task's goals and logical flow.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

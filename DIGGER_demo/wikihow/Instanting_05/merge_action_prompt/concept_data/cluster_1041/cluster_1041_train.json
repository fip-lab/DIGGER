The state changes for `covering_tracks` and `track` were used to reflect the movement and completion process.\n- The `choose_devotionals` and `check_devotionals` steps were clarified to represent the process of selecting and proofreading devotionals, with state transitions for the `devotionals` entity (`in progress` \u2192 `completed`).\n- The `submit_collection` step was tied to the final submission, requiring all prior steps to be completed.\n\nThis approach ensures all steps are logically represented with precise preconditions and effects, while irrelevant or unclear steps were refined to align with the task's description.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The journal is moved from an available state to the NPC's inventory.\n\n2. **keep_log**: Places the log at the NPC's favorite reading spot, ensuring it is accessible for writing later.\n\n3. **read_book**: Captures the action of reading a book actively and widely. The state of the book changes to \"read.\"\n\n4. **read_slowly**: Focuses on reading the book carefully, leading to a deeper understanding of its content.\n\n5. **write_bibliographic_info**: Logs bibliographic details of the book into the reading log.\n\n6. **listen_to_broadcast**: Represents the action of listening to a broadcast to gather additional knowledge, which can later be used in the log.\n\n7. **write_page_number**: Logs the page numbers of favorite passages from the book into the journal.\n\n8. **take_note**: Represents the action of taking notes while reading, which is a critical part of maintaining a reading log.\n\n9. **reflect_on_book**: Captures the reflection process after completing the book, which is logged into the journal.\n\n10. **reread_journal**: Allows the NPC to reread their journal to reinforce knowledge and reflect on past readings.\n\n---\n\n### Entity State Changes:\n\n- **Journal (log)**:\n  - Transitioned from \"available\" to \"inventory\" during the purchase.\n  - Positioned at a specific location (favorite reading spot) during the \"keep_log\" action.\n\n- **Book**:\n  - Transitioned from \"unread\" to \"read\" during the \"read_book\" action.\n  - Associated with bibliographic information, page numbers, and notes.\n\n- **NPC**:\n  - Gains knowledge and reflection through reading, listening, and journaling.\n\n- **Broadcast**:\n  - Provides external knowledge to the NPC.\n\n---\n\nThis PDDL representation ensures that the task of writing a reading log is logically and systematically represented, with attention to entity state transitions and task-specific details.\n(:action reread_eraser\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?ct - covering_tracks ?t - track)\n    :precondition (and (at_location ?ct in_cage) (smooth ?t))\n    :effect (and (reviewed ?ct) (reminiscing ?npc) (not (smooth ?t)))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Each Action:\n\n1. **choose_journal**: This action represents selecting a journal. The preconditions ensure the journal is available and not already chosen. The effects assign the journal to the person (NPC).\n\n2. **make_journal**: This action creates a journal at a workstation. The workstation\u2019s state transitions from \"not created\" to \"created,\" making it usable.\n\n3. **put_stuff_in_bag**: This action moves \"stuff\" from the store to the home. The preconditions check the initial location, and the effects update the location accordingly.\n\n4. **treat_new_journal**: This action personalizes the journal by camouflaging the NPC and modifying the covering tracks and track states. The preconditions check the initial states of the NPC, covering tracks, and track, while the effects reflect the updated states.\n\n5. **create_happiness**: This action focuses on creating a positive emotional state for the NPC. The precondition ensures the NPC is in a \"thinking\" state, and the effect transitions them to a \"happy\" state.\n\n6. **turn_off_filter_and_in_inner_conspirator**: This action removes the filter from the oil tank and turns it off. The preconditions check the filter's initial location and state (on), and the effects update its location and state (removed and off).\n\n7. **put_in_cage**: This action moves the NPC and covering tracks into a cage, making the NPC visible again. The preconditions check the NPC's current state (camouflaged and invisible) and the tracks' location, while the effects update these states.\n\n8. **reread_eraser**: This action represents reviewing older entries or tracks. The preconditions ensure the covering tracks are in the cage and the track is smooth, and the effects reflect the NPC reminiscing and the track no longer being smooth.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The actions are designed to capture the intent and logical flow of the task steps.\n- State transitions for entities (e.g., NPC, filter, track, covering tracks) are carefully modeled based on the provided descriptions.\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps were adjusted to align with the task's purpose while maintaining logical consistency.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

    "\nYou're a professional AI, and you're able to combine multiple PDDL actions into one universal action. The merged action should:\n\nObjective:\nCombine multiple PDDL actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, capable of capturing and transforming the entity's state. The merged action should:\n\nGenerality: Use abstract parameters to adapt to a variety of tasks, avoiding being limited to specific types of actions.\nState Change: Each action must clearly describe the state change, gradually transforming the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nCore Logic: Retain the core logic of preconditions and effects without unnecessary complexity.\nAvoid Redundancy: Merge actions with similar effects to ensure simplicity and efficiency.\nLogical Consistency: The merged action should maintain reasonable preconditions and effects in different contexts.\n\nGuidelines:\nGenerality: The merged action should apply to multiple tasks, especially those involving checking, modifying, or creating. Ensure the use of abstract parameters to increase applicability.\nState Change: The preconditions and effects of each action should clearly reflect the change in state. Through a series of actions, progressively transform the entity's state until the goal state is reached.\nSimplicity: Avoid redundancy and ensure the merged action is simple and efficient by removing unnecessary complexity.\nLogical Consistency: Each action should maintain consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nExamples of actions you are given:\n\nAction name after merge: check\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n\"(:action check_bestseller_list ;  Check the bestseller list for book recommendations\n  :parameters (? npc - person ? book - book) \n\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked_list ? npc ? book)))\n\n:effect (and (checked_list ? npc ? book))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\n\n(:action listen_to_member_secret ;  assign a member to keep track of loans and listen to their suggestions\n\n:parameters (? leader - player ? member - player ? bc - book_club)\n\n:precondition (and (in ? leader ? bc) (in ? member ? bc) (not (loan_tracker ? member ? bc)))\n      :effect (loan_tracker ? member ? bc))\n\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:\n(:action check ;  Check a resource and update task status\n:parameters (? npc - person ? item - object)\n:precondition (and (available ? npc) (not (checked ? npc ? item)))\n:effect (checked ? npc ? item))\n\n\nHere are our tasks\n\nAction name after merge:putobjectinreceptacle\n\n\nAction sets that need to be merged:\n(:action putobjectinreceptacle\n    :parameters (?agent1 - agent ?journal1 - journal)\n    :precondition (and (proper_grammar_used ?agent1) (not (journal_stored ?journal1)))\n    :effect (and (journal_stored ?journal1))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Actions:\n\n1. **`organize_thoughts`**:\n   - **Purpose**: Represents the step where the NPC organizes their thoughts to make them coherent.\n   - **Precondition**: The NPC has not yet organized their thoughts (`not (thoughts_organized ?npc)`).\n   - **Effect**: The NPC's thoughts are now organized (`thoughts_organized ?npc`).\n\n2. **`set_word_count`**:\n   - **Purpose**: Ensures the NPC sets the required word count while covering tracks.\n   - **Precondition**: The NPC has organized their thoughts (`thoughts_organized ?npc`), the word count has not been set (`not (word_count_set ?npc)`), and the track is stable and present (`stability_smooth ?track`, `location_present ?track`).\n   - **Effect**: The word count is set (`word_count_set ?npc`), and the track's location changes to absent (`location_absent ?track`).\n\n3. **`use_grammar`**:\n   - **Purpose**: Represents the step where the NPC uses proper grammar in writing the journal entry.\n   - **Precondition**: The NPC has organized their thoughts and set the word count (`thoughts_organized ?npc`, `word_count_set ?npc`), and proper grammar has not been used (`not (proper_grammar_used ?npc)`).\n   - **Effect**: Proper grammar is now used (`proper_grammar_used ?npc`).\n\n4. **`putobjectinreceptacle`**:\n   - **Purpose**: Represents the action of storing the journal after completing the entry.\n   - **Precondition**: The agent has used proper grammar (`proper_grammar_used ?agent1`), and the journal has not yet been stored (`not (journal_stored ?journal1)`).\n   - **Effect**: The journal is now stored (`journal_stored ?journal1`).\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- The step `set_word_count` was adapted to include interaction with the `track` entity, based on its attributes (`stability` and `location`), to align with the entity state transitions provided.\n- The step `putobjectinreceptacle` was modified to represent storing the journal (`journal_stored`) as the final action, ensuring it aligns with the task description of completing a journal entry.\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps were excluded or adjusted to fit the logical flow of writing a journal entry.\n\nThis set of actions captures the logical progression of the task, ensuring each step reflects meaningful state changes in the relevant entities.\nThe actions after the merger are:"

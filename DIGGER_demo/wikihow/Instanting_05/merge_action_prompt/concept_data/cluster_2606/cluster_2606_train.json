The state of the `track` changes from being \"in cabinet\" to \"on countertop,\" indicating that the template or related materials have been accessed.\n\n2. **prepare_content**: This action represents the preparation of content. The `content` moves from \"in store\" to \"in home,\" and the agent (`you`) changes focus from \"focused on making bracelet\" to \"admiring bracelet,\" reflecting a state of readiness.\n\n3. **pick_composing_style**: This action involves selecting a composing style for the memory book. The state of the `character` changes from \"unselected\" and \"nameless\" to \"selected\" and \"named,\" indicating that a specific style has been chosen.\n\n4. **create_members_know**: This action signifies designing the memory book while involving `npc`. The `npc`'s decoration attribute changes from \"bare\" to \"camouflaged,\" and their visibility changes from \"visible\" to \"invisible,\" suggesting a creative or hidden design process.\n\n5. **gather_members**: This action involves gathering members or contributors for the memory book. The `memory_book` transitions from being \"in store\" and \"for sale\" to \"in home\" and \"purchased,\" indicating that the necessary materials or contributions have been acquired.\n\n---\n\nThese PDDL actions accurately reflect the state changes associated with each step of the task and align with the provided descriptions and entity states.\n(:action gather_cook\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?kitchen - location ?recipes - recipe)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?kitchen) (available ?recipes))\n    :effect (and (collected ?recipes) (not (available ?recipes)))\n)\n```\n\n#### 3.

The precondition checks that both the moment and the character are unselected, and the effect marks them as selected.\n\n2. **`pistol_shot`**: This action uses a pistol shot as a cue to signify the start of the flashback. The precondition ensures the NPC is visible and the moment is unfinished. The effect marks the moment as cued and finished.\n\n3. **`label_with_name`**: This action labels the flashback by associating it with a character's name. The precondition checks that the character is nameless and the NPC is visible. The effect labels the character with the NPC's name.\n\n4. **`set_back_door`**: This action sets the back door of the flashback scene in the hallway. The precondition ensures the NPC is plain and the hallway is messy. The effect camouflages the NPC and cleans the hallway.\n\n5. **`set_transition_into_flashback`**: This action establishes a clear transition into the flashback. The precondition checks that the character and moment are selected and the moment is unfinished. The effect transitions the character into the flashback and marks the moment as finished.\n\n6. **`make_smooth_transition_out_of_flashback`**: This action ensures a smooth transition out of the flashback. The precondition checks that the character is in the flashback and the moment is finished. The effect transitions the character out of the flashback and marks the moment as completed.\n\nThese actions reflect the logical flow of writing a flashback and incorporate entity state transitions to capture the changes in the flashback process.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

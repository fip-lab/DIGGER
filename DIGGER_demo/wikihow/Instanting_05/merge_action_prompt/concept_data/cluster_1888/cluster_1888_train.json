The precondition checks that the eggs are in a container and the bowl is empty. The effect updates the state to reflect that the eggs are now in the bowl.\n\n2. **`add_ingredients_into_bowl`**: This action adds milk into the mixing bowl. The precondition ensures that the milk is in a container and the bowl is not already full. The effect reflects the milk being added to the bowl and the bowl becoming full.\n\n3. **`light_beat_with_oven`**: This action lightly beats the eggs and milk mixture. The precondition ensures that the NPC is at the mixing area, the bowl is full, and the mixture has not yet been beaten. The effect updates the state to reflect that the mixture is now beaten.\n\n4. **`pour_into_frying_pan`**: This action pours the beaten mixture and oil into a frying pan. The precondition ensures that the mixture is beaten, the oil is in a container, and the frying pan is empty. The effect reflects the mixture and oil being in the pan.\n\n5. **`turn_off_oven`**: This action turns off the oven after cooking. The precondition ensures that the oven is on and the NPC is at the stove area. The effect updates the state to reflect that the oven is now off.\n\n6. **`roll_egg_into_cylinder`**: This action rolls the cooled egg into a cylinder shape. The precondition checks that the egg is cooled, flat, and still in the frying pan. The effect reflects the egg being rolled into a cylinder.\n\n7. **`cut_cylinder`**: This action cuts the rolled egg cylinder into strips. The precondition ensures that the egg is in a cylindrical shape. The effect updates the state to reflect that the egg is now cut into strips.\n\n8. **`put_ingredients_in_dish`**: This action places the egg strips onto a dish. The precondition ensures that the egg strips are cut and the dish is empty. The effect reflects the egg strips being placed on the dish and the dish being served.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The entity states (e.g., `empty`, `full`, `beaten`, `cylinder`, `cut_into_strips`) are derived from the task description and entity knowledge provided.\n- The actions are designed to align with the logical progression of the task and ensure that each step reflects the relevant state changes of the entities involved.\n\n(:action put_ingredients_in_container\n    :parameters (?bowl - mixing_bowl ?table - table)\n    :precondition (and (empty ?bowl) (on ?bowl ?table))\n    :effect (and (not (empty ?bowl)) (filled ?bowl))\n)\n```\n\n#### 3.

The state `is_hot_day` is used to track this.\n\n2. **`place_in_sunlight`:**\n   - The action involves placing a metal surface (e.g., tin foil or a metal pan) in direct sunlight to heat it up. The state `heated` is used to indicate that the metal surface is now ready for cooking.\n\n3. **`crack_egg_on_metal`:**\n   - This action cracks an egg onto the heated metal surface. The state `cracked` is used to represent the egg's change, and `on_surface` tracks its location.\n\n4. **`crack_egg_on_sidewalk`:**\n   - Similar to the previous action, this involves cracking an egg directly onto the sidewalk. The same states (`cracked` and `on_surface`) are used to track the egg's state and location.\n\n5. **`discard_eggs`:**\n   - This action discards the eggs after the task is complete. The state `discarded` is used to represent that the eggs are no longer in use.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The action `dissolve_eggs` was not included because it does not align with the task's description or logical flow. Instead, a `discard_eggs` action was added to handle the cleanup phase.\n- The entity states, such as `is_hot_day`, `heated`, `cracked`, `on_surface`, and `discarded`, were chosen to capture the key transitions in the task.\n- Preconditions and effects were carefully crafted to ensure logical consistency and adherence to the task's description.\n(:action flip_egg\n    :parameters (?egg - ingredient ?pan - tool)\n    :precondition (and\n        (fried ?egg)\n        (in-pan ?egg ?pan)\n        (heated ?pan)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (flipped ?egg)\n        (evenly-cooked ?egg)\n    )\n)\n\n;; Action 3: Serve the fried egg on a plate\n\n(:action flip-egg-twice\n    :parameters (?e - egg)\n    :precondition (and (flipped ?e) (yolkIntact ?e))\n    :effect (and (flippedTwice ?e) (not (flipped ?e)))\n)\n\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The state of the vegetables changes from `raw` to `cooked`, and the kitchen becomes `messy`.\n\n2. **add_wet_ingredients**: Adds wet ingredients (like sauces or liquids) to the mixing bowl along with the cooked vegetables. The mixing bowl's state changes to `wet`.\n\n3. **make_spring_roll**: Wraps the cooked filling in a wrapper on a rolling board. The rolling board transitions from `clean` to `dirty`.\n\n4. **loot_wrapped**: Represents the action of lifting the wrapper and tucking it under the filling. This changes the state of the wrapper and filling to `tucked`.\n\n5. **repeat_roll**: Repeats the rolling process until all rolls are completed. This ensures the state of the filling and wrapper transitions to `rolled`.\n\n6. **fry_ingredients**: Fries the rolled spring rolls (egg rolls) in the kitchen. The egg rolls transition to `fried` and become `hot`.\n\n7. **serve_spring_rolls**: Represents the final action of serving the fried spring rolls to the table. The egg rolls' state changes to `served`.\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The irrelevant or unclear steps (e.g., \"loot_wrapped\") were clarified and aligned with the task description.\n- Entity state transitions (e.g., `clean` \u2192 `dirty`, `raw` \u2192 `cooked`, `rolled` \u2192 `fried`) were carefully considered to ensure logical consistency.\n- The parameters, preconditions, and effects were designed to capture the intent and state changes described in the task.\n(:action serve_potatoes\n    :parameters (?potato_rolls - dish ?sauce - ingredient ?dish - utensil)\n    :precondition (and\n      (fried ?potato_rolls)\n      (at ?sauce fridge)\n      (clean ?dish)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (in_dish ?potato_rolls ?dish)\n      (in_dish ?sauce ?dish)\n      (not (fried ?potato_rolls))\n      (not (at ?sauce fridge))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Adjustments:\n1. **Entity State Transitions**:\n   - The state transitions of entities like `potato`, `oil`, `bread`, `mixture`, and `sauce` were carefully mapped to the preconditions and effects of each action.\n   - For example, `potato` transitions from `whole` to `peeled`, `mixture` transitions to a `shaped` state, and `oil` transitions from a bottle to being in the pan.\n\n2. **Task-Specific Adjustments**:\n   - Some steps (e.g., \"remove from heat\") were clarified to align with the task's logic.\n   - The step \"cut_bread_sliplargerbeads velveeta\" was modified to \"cut_bread\" as it seemed to refer to cutting bread slices.\n\n3. **Relevance of Actions**:\n   - Actions irrelevant to the task or unclear were adjusted to fit the logical sequence of making Indian potato bread rolls.\n\n4. **Consistency with Entity Knowledge**:\n   - Attributes like `clean`, `dirty`, `wrapped`, and `fried` were used to reflect the described transitions in the entities' states.\n\nThis PDDL set accurately reflects the task steps and ensures logical state changes for all entities involved.\n(:action serve_egg\n    :parameters (?egg - ingredient ?plate - dish ?kitchen - location)\n    :precondition (and\n        (fried ?egg)\n        (evenly-cooked ?egg)\n        (at-dish ?plate ?kitchen)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (in-dish ?egg ?plate)\n        (not (fried ?egg))\n        (served ?egg)\n    )\n)\n\n;; Action 4: Place the fried egg in the fridge for later\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The precondition ensures the bread is smooth and located on the table. The effect updates the bread's state to flattened and coated with egg wash.\n\n2. **`spread_egg_wash_on_pie_crust`**: This action represents spreading egg wash over the bottom of an unbaked pie crust. The precondition checks that the pie crust is unbaked and on the table. The effect marks the pie crust as coated with egg wash.\n\n3. **`seal_edges_with_egg_wash`**: This action seals the edges of pastry with egg wash. The precondition verifies that the pastry's edges are unsealed, and the effect updates the state to indicate the edges are sealed.\n\n4. **`cover_baked_items`**: This action covers the top of baked goods with egg wash. The precondition ensures the item is baked and on the table. The effect marks the item as coated with egg wash.\n\n5. **`secure_seeds_with_egg_wash`**: This action uses egg wash to secure seeds (or similar items) to a food item. The precondition ensures the seed is not already secured, and the effect updates the state to indicate the seed is secured and the item is coated with egg wash.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made\n- Some irrelevant or unclear steps (e.g., \"sliplargerbeads velveeta\") were modified or excluded as they did not align with the task description.\n- Each action was tailored to involve egg wash as the central ingredient and reflect the logical progression of the task.\n- State transitions (e.g., `flattened`, `coated_with`, `edges_sealed`, `secured`) were designed to capture specific changes in the entities' attributes.\n\nThis set of PDDL actions should accurately represent the task of making and applying an egg wash while adhering to the provided format and structure.\nThe actions after the merger are:",

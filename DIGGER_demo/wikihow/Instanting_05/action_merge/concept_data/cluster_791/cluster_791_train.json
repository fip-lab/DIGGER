    "(:action lick ; Lick an item and update its state\n:parameters (?actor - entity ?item - object)\n:precondition (and (dry ?item) (can_lick ?actor ?item))\n:effect (and (wet ?item) (not (dry ?item)))\n)\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters `?actor` and `?item` to ensure its applicability across a wide range of tasks. This allows any entity that can perform a licking action to interact with any object that is lickable.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - The action clearly describes the state change from `dry` to `wet`, reflecting the typical outcome of a licking action. This provides a straightforward transformation of the entity's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n   - By merging similar actions and using abstract parameters, the action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity. The focus is on the core change from `dry` to `wet`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n   - Preconditions ensure that the item is initially `dry` and can be licked by the actor. The effects consistently update the item's state to `wet` while removing the `dry` state, maintaining logical consistency across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable for various scenarios involving entities interacting with items by licking, updating the item's state accordingly.",
    "To create a universal \"locate\" action from the given action sets, we'll need to ensure that the merged action adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Let's proceed with the merger:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```plaintext\n(:action locate ; Locate a resource and update its status\n :parameters (?agent - agent ?resource - resource)\n :precondition (not (located ?resource))\n :effect (and (located ?resource) (selected ?agent))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters have been generalized to `?agent` and `?resource` to make the action applicable to various tasks, beyond just wicks and users. This allows for flexibility in using the action with different types of agents and resources.\n\n- **State Change**: The precondition ensures that the resource is not already located, and the effect clearly describes the state change by marking the resource as located and selecting the agent.\n\n- **Simplicity**: The action has been streamlined to focus on the core logic of locating a resource, avoiding any unnecessary complexity or redundancy.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains a logical sequence of preconditions and effects, ensuring that it can be applied consistently across different contexts.\n\nThis universal \"locate\" action is now adaptable to a variety of tasks that involve identifying or finding resources, maintaining simplicity and efficiency.",
    "To merge the given PDDL action into a single, more general action, we'll follow the provided guidelines and ensure that the merged action is adaptable to various scenarios while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity:\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```lisp\n(:action wick ; Generalized action for wicking and centering processes\n    :parameters (?w - wick ?m - object)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?m) (not (processed ?m)))\n    :effect (and (processed ?m) (centered ?w ?m))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named \"wick\" to reflect its general purpose related to wicking and centering tasks.\n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?w - wick` and `?m - object`, allowing the action to be applied to any wicking and centering process beyond just molds.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(prepared ?m)` ensures that the object is ready for the process, and `(not (processed ?m))` checks that the process hasn't already been completed.\n   - The effect `(processed ?m)` indicates that the object has been wicked, and `(centered ?w ?m)` specifies that the wick is centered in the object.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action removes any unnecessary complexity and focuses on the core logic needed to perform the task, making it efficient and easy to understand.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are defined clearly and align with the logical flow of the tasks involved, ensuring that the action remains valid in various contexts.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible template that can be applied to a broad range of tasks involving wicking and centering processes.",
    "To create a universal PDDL action named \"reuse\" that encapsulates the provided actions, we need to identify abstract parameters and unify the preconditions and effects across different actions. The goal is to have a generalized action that can adapt to various tasks involving the reuse of items. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action reuse\n  ; Reuse an item by cleaning and storing it for future use\n  :parameters (?item - object ?location - place ?new_location - place ?cleaner - object)\n  \n  :precondition (and\n    (location ?item ?location)\n    (cleanness ?item clean)\n    (not (stored ?item ?new_location))\n    (available ?cleaner)\n  )\n  \n  :effect (and\n    (location ?item ?new_location)\n    (stored ?item ?new_location)\n    (not (available ?cleaner))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?item`, `?location`, `?new_location`, and `?cleaner` to apply to various objects and locations, making it adaptable to different tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition requires the item to be in a specific location and clean, with a cleaner available. The effect is that the item is moved to a new location (indicating reuse), and the cleaner is no longer available.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The action retains the core logic of ensuring an item is clean and available for reuse by moving it to storage or a new location, which is a common requirement in reuse scenarios.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By combining similar effects and preconditions from the original actions, the merged action eliminates redundancy.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring the action is applicable to a variety of reuse tasks.",
    "To create a merged action that captures the essence of practicing with different entities, we will generalize the state changes and ensure logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action practice\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?technique - technique)\n    :precondition (and (unpracticed ?entity ?technique))\n    :effect (and (practiced ?entity ?technique) (not (unpracticed ?entity ?technique)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?technique` to allow for a wide range of tasks involving any entity practicing any technique. This makes it adaptable to many scenarios beyond just NPCs or specific equipment.\n\n2. **State Change**: The core logic of the precondition checks if the `?entity` has not practiced the `?technique` yet (`unpracticed ?entity ?technique`). The effect ensures that after the action, the technique is marked as practiced (`practiced ?entity ?technique`), and the unpracticed state is removed.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action retains the fundamental preconditions and effects needed to express the practice process without unnecessary complexity or redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects clearly represent the transformation from an unpracticed to a practiced state, maintaining consistency across various contexts.\n\nThis universal action effectively abstracts the practice process, allowing it to be applied to a variety of scenarios and entities, while clearly delineating the change in state."

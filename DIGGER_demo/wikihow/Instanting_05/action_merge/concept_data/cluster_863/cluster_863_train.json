This ensures that the action is only applicable when the necessary conditions are met.\n   - **Effect**: The effect of the action is to mark the resource as selected by the agent, indicating a change in state that progresses toward the goal.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action consolidates the effects of the original actions (waiting and selecting oil) into a single, streamlined effect (`selected ?agent ?resource`), thereby avoiding redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains a logical flow by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts. It clearly reflects the transition from an unselected state to a selected state for any applicable resource.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged \"gather\" action is both versatile and efficient, making it suitable for various scenarios that involve selecting or gathering resources.",

Here's how we can structure the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: apply\n\n```lisp\n(:action apply ; Apply a product or perform an application-related task\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?item - item)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (prepared ?entity) ; A general condition for readiness\n                    (available ?item)  ; Ensures the item to be applied is available\n                    (not (applied ?entity ?item))) ; The item hasn't been applied yet\n    :effect (and\n              (applied ?entity ?item) ; Marks the item as applied\n              (transformed_state ?entity ?item)) ; Represents any transformation or effect due to the application\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (`?entity` and `?item`) to handle a variety of tasks (e.g., applying creams, powders, or other items). This ensures the action can be used across different scenarios without being tied to specific items like \"Nair\" or \"depilatory cream.\"\n\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects are designed to reflect a typical state change associated with an application action. For instance, `prepared ?entity` and `available ?item` are generic conditions that can fit many contexts.\n\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by abstracting the specific conditions from the original actions into generalized ones. This ensures that the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The merged action ensures logical consistency by maintaining clear preconditions and effects that can apply to different contexts. It uses `transformed_state ?entity ?item` to generalize the specific effects (like removing hair or applying powder) into a single concept.\n\nBy structuring the merged action this way, it retains the core logic of the original actions while broadening its applicability to a range of tasks involving application.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action while following the provided guidelines, we need to abstract the actions to ensure they can be adapted to a variety of tasks.

This makes it suitable for various scenarios where an agent needs to interact with a process or task.\n  \n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly depict the change in the state. The agent (`?npc`) must be prepared and have the process applied to them. The effect is the process being verified, indicating a progression towards the goal state.\n\n- **Core Logic**: The preconditions ensure that the process can only be verified if it has been properly prepared and applied, maintaining logical consistency. The effects are straightforward, marking the process as verified for the agent.\n\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: The action is simplified to focus on the essential logic of applying and verifying a process, eliminating any unnecessary complexity.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency across different contexts by using abstract parameters (`?npc` and `?process`) and ensuring that the preconditions align with the intended state change. \n\nThis merged action can now be adapted to various tasks involving applying and verifying processes, whether it's testing a patch, confirming an operation, or any similar task.",

The effect `(laid_out ?item)` updates the state to reflect that the item has been laid out.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action retains simplicity by having a single precondition and effect, which are directly related to the task of laying out an item.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic is consistent across different potential contexts, as it checks the status of the item before and after the action, ensuring that the action only changes the state when appropriate.\n\nIn future scenarios where more actions are to be merged into \"LayOutTowel,\" similar guidelines should be followed to maintain the action's applicability and efficiency across different tasks.",

This aligns with the goal of gradually transforming the entity's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is kept simple by using a general concept of \"comfort\" rather than being specific about \"sitting.\" This avoids unnecessary complexity and redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by clearly defining the precondition and effect related to the entity's comfort status. This ensures that the action can be reasonably applied in different scenarios where an entity needs to be made comfortable.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible and efficient way to represent tasks related to making an entity comfortable, whether it involves sitting or any other action that results in comfort.",

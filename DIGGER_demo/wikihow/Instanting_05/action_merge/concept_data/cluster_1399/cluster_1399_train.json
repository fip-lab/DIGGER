    "To create a merged action named `move`, we need to extract the core logic from the given actions and combine them into a universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks involving movement or transformation. Here's the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action move ; Move an agent to a target location or transform a state\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?target - place)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?agent ?location)\n    (not (at ?agent ?target))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (at ?agent ?target)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters `?agent` and `?target` to represent any entity and any place. This makes it adaptable to different scenarios where an entity needs to move or a state needs to change.\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition requires the agent to be at an initial location and not at the target location.

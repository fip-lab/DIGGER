    "To create a merged PDDL action named \"layer\" that encompasses the given action \"layer_cheese\" and potentially other similar actions, we need to ensure that it is abstract, general, and capable of handling various tasks involving layering or adding components. Here's how we can define the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action layer ; Layer an item onto a target\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?container - container ?target - target)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?container) (is_layerable ?item) (is_target ?target) (has_detail ?target))\n  :effect (and (has_layer ?target ?item) (in ?item ?container))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstract and can represent various entities involved in layering tasks. For instance, `?actor` can be any agent performing the action, `?item` can be any object being layered, `?container` can be any container or location where the action is performed, and `?target` can be the entity receiving the layer.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures that the actor is at the container/location, the item is layerable (generalizing \"is_cheese\"), the target is a valid target (generalizing \"is_hamburger\"), and the target has specific details required for layering.\n   - The effect shows that the item is now a layer on the target and is within the container.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters instead of specific ones like \"cheese\" and \"hamburger.\"\n   - It captures the core logic without unnecessary complexity, making it adaptable to different scenarios involving layering.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain reasonable logic across various tasks, ensuring clarity and consistency.\n\nThis merged action is designed to be applicable in scenarios where layering or adding components to a target is required, such as cooking, assembling, or constructing tasks."

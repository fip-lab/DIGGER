    "Here\u2019s the merged **choose** action based on the given examples, adhering to the guidelines of generality, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: `choose`**\n```lisp\n(:action choose ; Choose an item and update its state\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?item - object ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?actor ?loc) ; The actor must be at the location\n        (available ?item ?loc) ; The item must be available at the location\n        (not (chosen ?item)) ; The item must not already be chosen\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (chosen ?item) ; Mark the item as chosen\n        (not (available ?item ?loc)) ; Mark the item as no longer available at the location\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### **Explanation of Merged Action:**\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The parameters are abstracted as `?actor`, `?item`, and `?loc`, allowing the action to be applied to different entities, objects, and locations (e.g., players choosing steaks, books, or any other items at a specified location).\n   - The `choose` action is now adaptable to any task involving the selection of an item or object.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure the selection process is valid (e.g., the actor is at the location, the item is available, and it hasn't already been chosen).\n   - Effects update the item's state, marking it as chosen and unavailable.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundant or task-specific details (e.g., limiting it to \"chuck steak\") are removed.\n   - The logic is streamlined for broader applicability.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain consistency across different contexts where the action might be applied.\n\n---\n\nThis merged `choose` action can now be used in various scenarios, from selecting menu items to reserving resources, with its abstract and flexible structure.",
    "Here's the merged action based on the given examples, ensuring generality, logical consistency, simplicity, and clear state change:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `store`\n\n```lisp\n(:action store ; Store an item at a specific location\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?from - location ?to - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?from) (at ?item ?from) (not (at ?item ?to)))\n    :effect (and (at ?item ?to) (not (at ?item ?from)))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters have been abstracted to include `?actor` (a general agent, such as a player), `?item` (any object, not limited to chuck steak), and `?from`/`?to` (general locations).\n   - This allows the action to be adaptable to a variety of tasks involving moving or \"storing\" an object from one location to another.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures that both the actor and the item are at the `from` location, and the item is not already at the target location (`to`).\n   - The effect reflects the state change: the item is moved to the `to` location, and it is no longer at the `from` location.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by generalizing the conditions and effects. For example, it removes specifics like \"chosen\" or \"chuck_steak\" and replaces them with abstract terms (`?item`).\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different contexts. The action ensures the actor and the item are present at the source location before allowing the transfer.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Covers the Original Actions:\n\n1. **Action: `store_chuck_steak`**:\n   - In the original action, a player moves a chuck steak from one location to another. This is a specific instance of the generalized `store` action where `?actor` is the player, `?item` is the chuck steak, and `?from`/`?to` are specific locations.\n\n2. **Adaptability**:\n   - The merged `store` action is not limited to chuck steak. It can be applied to any object (`?item`) being stored or moved by an actor from one location to another.\n\n---\n\nThis approach ensures the `store` action is simple, reusable, and adaptable to a variety of tasks involving moving or storing objects.",
    "### Merged Action: `make`\n\n```lisp\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - entity ?tool - entity ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc) \n        (at ?item ?loc) \n        (exists (?attribute - property) (has_state ?item ?attribute)) ;; General attribute or state\n        (exists (?action - action_type) (not (performed ?p ?action))) ;; Ensures the action isn't already done\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (exists (?new_state - property) (has_state ?item ?new_state)) ;; Item transitions to a new state\n        (not (exists (?old_state - property) (has_state ?item ?old_state))) ;; Removes old state\n        (performed ?p ?action) ;; Marks the action performed\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of `make` Merged Action:\n\nThe `make` action is designed to generically encapsulate the process of preparing, transforming, or crafting an object or entity. It combines the logic of multiple actions, such as preparing food, turning on equipment, or modifying states of items, into one universal action.\n\n#### Key Features:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action uses abstract parameters (`?item`, `?tool`, `?loc`) to represent any entity, tool, or location involved in the making process.\n   - It works for tasks like chopping, cooking, preparing, or assembling.\n\n2. **Preconditions**:\n   - Ensures the player (`?p`) is at the correct location (`?loc`).\n   - Validates if the item (`?item`) is in the required initial state by checking the presence of a specific attribute (`?attribute`).\n   - Ensures the action has not already been performed.\n\n3. **Effects**:\n   - Updates the state of the item (`?item`) to a new state (`?new_state`).\n   - Removes the old state (`?old_state`) of the item.\n   - Marks the action as performed for the player (`performed ?p ?action`).\n\n4. **State Change**:\n   - Gradually transitions the entity from an initial state to a goal state (e.g., whole \u2192 chopped \u2192 cooked \u2192 served).\n\n5. **Simplicity & Redundancy Avoidance**:\n   - The action eliminates the need to define separate actions (e.g., `prepare_chuck_steak`, `cook_chuck_steak`, etc.) by generalizing the logic.\n\n6. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Maintains the same structure and logic regardless of the specific task, ensuring adaptability and logical coherence.\n\n---\n\n### Example Applications of `make`:\n\n#### 1. Preparing Chuck Steak:\n```lisp\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?p - player ?cs - chuck_steak ?loc - kitchen)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc) \n        (at ?cs ?loc) \n        (has_state ?cs whole)\n        (not (performed ?p chop))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (has_state ?cs chopped)\n        (not (has_state ?cs whole))\n        (performed ?p chop)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### 2. Turning On Stove:\n```lisp\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?p - player ?st - stove ?loc - kitchen)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc) \n        (at ?st ?loc) \n        (has_state ?st off)\n        (not (performed ?p power_on))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (has_state ?st on)\n        (not (has_state ?st off))\n        (performed ?p power_on)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### 3. Cooking Chuck Steak:\n```lisp\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?p - player ?cs - chuck_steak ?loc - kitchen)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc) \n        (at ?cs ?loc) \n        (has_state ?cs chopped)\n        (not (performed ?p cook))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (has_state ?cs cooked)\n        (not (has_state ?cs chopped))\n        (performed ?p cook)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### 4. Making Marinade:\n```lisp\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?p - player ?v - velveeta ?loc - kitchen)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?loc) \n        (at ?v ?loc) \n        (has_state ?v solid)\n        (not (performed ?p prepare_marinade))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (has_state ?v liquid)\n        (not (has_state ?v solid))\n        (performed ?p prepare_marinade)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of the Merged Action:\n1. **Flexibility**: The `make` action can handle a wide range of tasks by changing the parameters and states.\n2. **Simplification**: Reduces the need for defining separate actions for each task, leading to a simpler PDDL domain file.\n3. **State Transition**: Ensures that each task step results in a clear and progressive state change.\n4. **Reusability**: The same action can be reused for different tasks by modifying the parameters and preconditions.\n\nThis universal `make` action provides a robust framework for tasks involving preparation, transformation, or crafting in various contexts.",
    "Here\u2019s how the merged action for **serve** could look after consolidating the provided actions into a **universal serve action** that captures the generality, state changes, and logical consistency:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: Universal Serve\n```lisp\n(:action serve\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?from - location ?to - location ?state - state ?target_state - state)\n    :precondition (and\n        (at ?entity ?from)\n        (has_state ?entity ?state)\n        (is_prepared_for ?entity serve)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (not (at ?entity ?from))\n        (at ?entity ?to)\n        (not (has_state ?entity ?state))\n        (has_state ?entity ?target_state)\n        (served ?entity true)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is abstract to accommodate various tasks related to serving any entity or object (e.g., food, documents, tools).\n   - Parameters like `?entity`, `?from`, `?to`, `?state`, and `?target_state` allow this action to adapt to diverse scenarios, such as serving food, delivering items, or transferring objects.\n\n2. **State Changes:**\n   - The entity (`?entity`) is moved from its current location (`?from`) to the target location (`?to`).\n   - Its current state (`?state`) is transitioned to a target state (`?target_state`) to reflect the completion of the serving process (e.g., cooked \u2192 served, raw \u2192 prepared).\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that:\n     - The entity is at the expected starting location (`?from`).\n     - The entity has the necessary state (`?state`) required to be served.\n     - The entity is \"prepared\" for serving, represented by the predicate `(is_prepared_for ?entity serve)`. This could imply prior steps like cooking, assembling, or packaging have been completed.\n   - Effects include:\n     - Updating the entity's location (`?from` \u2192 `?to`).\n     - Transitioning the entity's state (`?state` \u2192 `?target_state`).\n     - Marking the entity as served using the `(served ?entity true)` predicate.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - This consolidated action eliminates repetitive logic across the individual `serve_chuck_steak` and `serve_steak` actions.\n   - The single universal action can handle serving any entity, provided the parameters are instantiated appropriately.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The precondition `(is_prepared_for ?entity serve)` ensures the entity has undergone the necessary preparatory steps (e.g., being cooked, plated, or arranged).\n   - The state transitions (`?state` \u2192 `?target_state`) and location changes (`?from` \u2192 `?to`) maintain clear and logical progressions in the task.\n\n---\n\n### Example Instantiations:\n\n#### Example 1: Serve Chuck Steak\n```lisp\n(serve ?entity - chuck_steak ?from - kitchen ?to - dining_table ?state - cooked ?target_state - served)\n```\n- Preconditions:\n  - `(at chuck_steak kitchen)`\n  - `(has_state chuck_steak cooked)`\n  - `(is_prepared_for chuck_steak serve)`\n- Effects:\n  - `(not (at chuck_steak kitchen))`\n  - `(at chuck_steak dining_table)`\n  - `(not (has_state chuck_steak cooked))`\n  - `(has_state chuck_steak served)`\n  - `(served chuck_steak true)`\n\n#### Example 2: Serve Salad\n```lisp\n(serve ?entity - salad ?from - fridge ?to - table ?state - prepped ?target_state - served)\n```\n- Preconditions:\n  - `(at salad fridge)`\n  - `(has_state salad prepped)`\n  - `(is_prepared_for salad serve)`\n- Effects:\n  - `(not (at salad fridge))`\n  - `(at salad table)`\n  - `(not (has_state salad prepped))`\n  - `(has_state salad served)`\n  - `(served salad true)`\n\n#### Example 3: Serve Chimichurri\n```lisp\n(serve ?entity - chimichurri ?from - counter ?to - plate ?state - in_bowl ?target_state - on_plate)\n```\n- Preconditions:\n  - `(at chimichurri counter)`\n  - `(has_state chimichurri in_bowl)`\n  - `(is_prepared_for chimichurri serve)`\n- Effects:\n  - `(not (at chimichurri counter))`\n  - `(at chimichurri plate)`\n  - `(not (has_state chimichurri in_bowl))`\n  - `(has_state chimichurri on_plate)`\n  - `(served chimichurri true)`\n\n---\n\nBy using this **universal serve action**, the system can flexibly handle a wide range of serving tasks without defining separate actions for each type of entity.",
    "To merge the actions into a **universal \"cut\" action** following the specified guidelines, we will create a generalized action that can handle cutting objects (e.g., steak, vegetables, etc.) while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity. The merged action will abstract parameters to allow for broader applicability while unifying the preconditions and effects.\n\n### Merged Action: `cut`\n```lisp\n(:action cut ; General action for cutting an object into a desired form\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object ?form - form_type)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?agent ?item)          ; The agent must be at the item's location\n    (cuttable ?item)           ; The item must be cuttable\n    (not (in_form ?item ?form)) ; The item must not already be in the desired form\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (not (whole ?item))        ; The item is no longer whole (if applicable)\n    (in_form ?item ?form)      ; The item is now in the desired form\n    (cut_by ?agent ?item)      ; Tracks which agent performed the cutting\n  )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is generalized to handle various objects (e.g., steak, asparagus) and forms (e.g., pieces, chopped). The use of `?agent`, `?item`, and `?form` allows it to adapt to a variety of cutting tasks.\n   - The `form_type` parameter (`?form`) abstracts the specific form the object should take after being cut (e.g., \"pieces\", \"chopped\").\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure the object is cuttable and not already in the desired form.\n   - The effects reflect the state change of the object (e.g., from whole to a specific form) and optionally track the agent responsible for the action.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancies across actions are removed. For example, the conditions `(at ?item kitchen_counter)` and `(form ?steak whole)` are unified under a single `cuttable` predicate.\n   - The `exposed` effect from the steak-cutting action is implicitly handled by the `in_form` predicate, which can be extended to represent visibility of the inside if needed.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent and adaptable to various contexts involving cutting tasks, such as cutting a steak into pieces or chopping asparagus.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Covers the Original Actions\n\n1. **`cut_into_thickest_piece`**:\n   - The precondition `(whole ?steak)` is generalized to `(cuttable ?item)`.\n   - The effect `(not (whole ?steak))` is retained as `(not (whole ?item))`.\n   - The effect `(in_pieces ?steak)` is generalized to `(in_form ?item ?form)`.\n\n2. **`chop_asparagus`**:\n   - The precondition `(form ?steak whole)` is generalized to `(cuttable ?item)` and `(not (in_form ?item ?form))`.\n   - The effect `(form ?steak chopped)` is generalized to `(in_form ?item ?form)`.\n   - The effect `(asparagus_chopped ?p)` is replaced by the generalized effect `(cut_by ?agent ?item)`.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases for the Merged Action\n\n1. **Cut Steak into Pieces**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action cut\n     :parameters (?chef - person ?steak - steak ?form - form_type)\n     :precondition (and\n       (at ?chef ?steak)\n       (cuttable ?steak)\n       (not (in_form ?steak pieces))\n     )\n     :effect (and\n       (not (whole ?steak))\n       (in_form ?steak pieces)\n       (cut_by ?chef ?steak)\n     )\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Chop Asparagus**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action cut\n     :parameters (?player - person ?asparagus - vegetable ?form - form_type)\n     :precondition (and\n       (at ?player ?asparagus)\n       (cuttable ?asparagus)\n       (not (in_form ?asparagus chopped))\n     )\n     :effect (and\n       (in_form ?asparagus chopped)\n       (cut_by ?player ?asparagus)\n     )\n   )\n   ```\n\n---\n\nThis universal **`cut`** action is highly adaptable and maintains the core logic of the original actions while simplifying and generalizing the structure.",
    "To create a merged `check` action, we must generalize the parameters and ensure the preconditions and effects are adaptable to the tasks while maintaining logical consistency. Below is the resulting universal `check` action:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `check`\n```lisp\n(:action check ; A generic action to check the state of an entity or resource\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?target - object ?attribute - attribute)\n  :precondition (and\n    (available ?agent)                ;; The agent must be available\n    (state ?target ?attribute false)  ;; The target's attribute must not already be checked\n    (precondition_for ?attribute ?target)) ;; Any additional preconditions specific to the attribute\n  :effect (and\n    (state ?target ?attribute true))  ;; Mark the target's attribute as checked\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action uses abstract parameters:\n     - `?agent` represents the entity (e.g., NPC, player, or sensor) performing the check.\n     - `?target` represents the object or resource being checked (e.g., steak, book, person).\n     - `?attribute` represents the specific property or state being checked (e.g., doneness, firmness, bestseller list).\n   - The action is applicable to a wide range of tasks by introducing the `?attribute` parameter to generalize the type of check.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The `precondition_for` predicate allows the specification of additional context-specific preconditions for attributes (e.g., a steak must be `cooked` before checking its doneness).\n   - The `state` predicate models whether the attribute of the target has been checked or not. It is updated as part of the effect.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:**\n   - Similar actions (e.g., `check_doneness`, `check_meat`, `check_bestseller_list`) are merged into a single action by abstracting their preconditions and effects.\n   - The `state` predicate replaces specific predicates like `doneness_checked`, `firmness_checked`, and `checked_list`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The `precondition_for` predicate ensures the action remains logically consistent across varied tasks. For example:\n     - `precondition_for doneness steak` might enforce `(cooked ?steak)`.\n     - `precondition_for bestseller_list book` might enforce `(available ?npc)`.\n\n---\n\n### Examples of Use:\n1. **Checking Steak Doneness:**\n   ```lisp\n   (check ?chef ?steak doneness)\n   ```\n\n   Preconditions:\n   ```lisp\n   (available ?chef)\n   (state ?steak doneness false)\n   (precondition_for doneness steak) ;; Implies (cooked ?steak)\n   ```\n\n   Effects:\n   ```lisp\n   (state ?steak doneness true)\n   ```\n\n2. **Checking Bestseller List:**\n   ```lisp\n   (check ?npc ?book bestseller_list)\n   ```\n\n   Preconditions:\n   ```lisp\n   (available ?npc)\n   (state ?book bestseller_list false)\n   (precondition_for bestseller_list book) ;; Implies (not (checked_list ?npc ?book))\n   ```\n\n   Effects:\n   ```lisp\n   (state ?book bestseller_list true)\n   ```\n\n3. **Checking Firmness of Meat:**\n   ```lisp\n   (check ?chef ?steak firmness)\n   ```\n\n   Preconditions:\n   ```lisp\n   (available ?chef)\n   (state ?steak firmness false)\n   (precondition_for firmness steak) ;; Implies (doneness_checked ?steak)\n   ```\n\n   Effects:\n   ```lisp\n   (state ?steak firmness true)\n   ```\n\n---\n\nThis merged `check` action is both adaptable and efficient, maintaining consistent logic and eliminating redundancy. It ensures that all tasks involving checking are unified under a single abstract action.",
    "Here\u2019s the merged \"use\" action:\n\n### Merged Action: `use`\n```lisp\n(:action use ; Utilize a resource to modify the state of an entity\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (requires_modification ?entity) (available ?resource))\n  :effect (and (modified ?entity) (not (requires_modification ?entity)) (not (available ?resource)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The merged action is abstract enough to apply to a variety of scenarios where an entity (e.g., an object, item, or state) requires modification using some resource.\n   - It is no longer specific to a steak or seasoning but instead uses generic parameters `?entity` and `?resource`.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition `(requires_modification ?entity)` ensures that the action applies only when the entity requires a change.\n   - The effect `(modified ?entity)` reflects the successful modification of the entity. Additionally, the resource's availability is updated by `(not (available ?resource))`.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - The merged action retains the logical structure of preconditions and effects from the original actions, ensuring that the resource must be available and the entity must require modification before the action can take place.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The use of generic parameters and abstract predicates (e.g., `requires_modification`, `modified`, `available`) eliminates redundancy, making the action adaptable to a broader set of use cases.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action remains logically consistent across tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects align with the intended transformation of the entity's state.\n\n### Example Use Cases:\n- **Cooking:** Using a seasoning to modify a steak.\n  - `?entity = steak`, `?resource = seasoning`\n- **Cleaning:** Using a detergent to clean a surface.\n  - `?entity = surface`, `?resource = detergent`\n- **Repairing:** Using a tool to repair an object.\n  - `?entity = broken_object`, `?resource = tool`\n\nThis merged action is now a universal \"use\" action that can be applied to a wide range of tasks requiring the utilization of a resource to modify an entity's state.",
    "Here is the merged **\"place\"** action based on the given guidelines:\n\n---\n\n#### Merged Action: `place`\n```lisp\n(:action place\n  :parameters (?actor - actor ?item - object ?location - location ?resource - resource)\n  :precondition (and \n    (available ?actor) \n    (not (placed ?item ?location)) \n    (or \n      (and (cooked ?item) (available ?resource)) ; For slathering butter or similar\n      (and (inventory ?actor ?item) (uncooked ?item) (not (seasoned ?item))) ; For rubbing ingredients\n      (and (plain ?item) (separate ?resource)) ; For rubbing with spice mixture\n      (and (inventory ?actor ?item) (inventory ?actor ?resource) (marinated ?item) (clean ?location)) ; For placing in a bowl\n      (and (in_bowl ?item ?location) (not (in_fridge ?item)) (at ?actor ?location)) ; For placing in fridge\n    )\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (placed ?item ?location)\n    (or \n      (and (richly-flavored ?item) (not (available ?resource))) ; For slathering butter\n      (seasoned ?item) ; For rubbing ingredients\n      (and (seasoned ?item) (not (plain ?item)) (mixed ?resource) (not (separate ?resource))) ; For rubbing with spice mixture\n      (and (in_bowl ?item ?location) (added_to_bowl ?resource ?location) (not (inventory ?actor ?item)) (not (inventory ?actor ?resource))) ; For placing in a bowl\n      (and (in_fridge ?item) (cold ?item)) ; For placing in fridge\n    )\n  )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The `place` action uses abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?item`, `?location`, and `?resource` to generalize its application across a variety of tasks, from placing items in a bowl to slathering butter or seasoning steak.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The `precondition` and `effect` sections explicitly describe how the state of the `?item` and `?resource` changes. For example:\n     - When slathering butter, the resource (`?resource`) becomes unavailable, and the steak (`?item`) becomes richly flavored.\n     - When seasoning, the `?item` transitions from plain to seasoned.\n     - When placing in a fridge, the `?item` becomes cold and is marked as being in the fridge.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy by merging similar effects (e.g., seasoning, marinating, and placing in locations) into one unified logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent with their respective tasks. For instance:\n     - Slathering butter requires the steak to be cooked and butter to be available.\n     - Rubbing ingredients requires the steak to be uncooked and not yet seasoned.\n     - Placing items in a bowl requires both the item and resource to be in the actor's inventory, and the bowl to be clean.\n\n5. **Adaptability**:\n   - The `place` action can handle a wide range of tasks involving the placement, seasoning, or transformation of an item, making it highly reusable across different contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Example Scenarios:\n\n1. **Slathering Butter**:\n   - Parameters: `?actor = chef`, `?item = steak`, `?location = none`, `?resource = butter`\n   - Preconditions: `(cooked steak)`, `(available butter)`\n   - Effects: `(richly-flavored steak)`, `(not available butter)`\n\n2. **Rubbing Ingredients**:\n   - Parameters: `?actor = player1`, `?item = steak`, `?location = none`, `?resource = none`\n   - Preconditions: `(inventory player1 steak)`, `(uncooked steak)`, `(not seasoned steak)`\n   - Effects: `(seasoned steak)`\n\n3. **Placing in Bowl**:\n   - Parameters: `?actor = player1`, `?item = steak`, `?location = bowl`, `?resource = spice`\n   - Preconditions: `(inventory player1 steak)`, `(inventory player1 spice)`, `(marinated steak)`, `(clean bowl)`\n   - Effects: `(in_bowl steak bowl)`, `(added_to_bowl spice bowl)`, `(not inventory player1 steak)`, `(not inventory player1 spice)`\n\n4. **Placing in Fridge**:\n   - Parameters: `?actor = player1`, `?item = steak`, `?location = fridge`, `?resource = none`\n   - Preconditions: `(in_bowl steak bowl)`, `(not in_fridge steak)`, `(at player1 fridge)`\n   - Effects: `(in_fridge steak)`, `(cold steak)`\n\n---\n\nThis merged `place` action achieves the goals of generality, state change clarity, simplicity, and logical consistency while being adaptable to diverse scenarios.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal **`add`** action that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we must identify the common logic across the actions and abstract their parameters. Here's the resulting merged action:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `add`\n\n```pddl\n(:action add ; Add one entity to another, transforming their states\n    :parameters (?entity1 - object ?entity2 - object ?container - object)\n    :precondition (and\n        (available ?entity2) ; The second entity must be available for use\n        (compatible ?entity1 ?entity2) ; The two entities must be compatible for addition\n        (not (combined ?entity1 ?entity2)) ; They must not already be combined\n        (in ?container) ; The container must exist for the operation\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (combined ?entity1 ?entity2) ; The entities are now combined\n        (not (available ?entity2)) ; The second entity is no longer available\n        (contained_in ?entity1 ?container) ; The first entity now resides in the container\n        (not (plain ?entity1)) ; The first entity is no longer plain\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is adaptable to a variety of tasks by using abstract parameters (`?entity1`, `?entity2`, `?container`).\n   - The precondition `(compatible ?entity1 ?entity2)` ensures logical flexibility while preventing invalid combinations.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action transitions the state of the entities from separate (`available`, `plain`, etc.) to combined (`combined`, `not available`, `not plain`).\n   - The addition is reflected in the `contained_in` effect, showing the final location of `?entity1`.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Each action in the original set involves adding one entity to another, with state transformations (e.g., `topped`, `not plain`, `used`, etc.).\n   - The merged action retains this core logic with abstract parameters to increase generality.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - By merging similar actions (e.g., adding cheese, mixing flavors, rubbing ingredients), the action avoids repetitive logic.\n   - The single action handles all scenarios where one entity is added to another, removing unnecessary complexity.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the entities are compatible, the second entity is available, and the container exists, maintaining logical consistency across tasks.\n   - Effects clearly describe the state changes in a reasonable and adaptable manner.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Covers the Original Actions:\n\n1. **`add-cheese-to-steak`**:\n   - `?entity1` = steak, `?entity2` = cheese, `?container` = plate.\n   - Preconditions: `(cooked ?entity1)` maps to `compatible ?entity1 ?entity2`, and `(available ?entity2)` remains unchanged.\n   - Effects: `(topped ?entity1 ?entity2)` maps to `(combined ?entity1 ?entity2)`, with additional effects like `(not (available ?entity2))`.\n\n2. **`rub-ingredients-with-spice`**:\n   - `?entity1` = steak, `?entity2` = spice, `?container` = workspace.\n   - The precondition `(plain ?entity1)` is implied by `(not (combined ?entity1 ?entity2))`, ensuring logical consistency.\n   - The effect `(seasoned ?entity1)` is abstracted to `(not (plain ?entity1))`.\n\n3. **`mix_flavor`**:\n   - `?entity1` = garlic, `?entity2` = herbs, `?container` = mixing bowl.\n   - The precondition `(at_location ?garlic in_pantry)` maps to `(available ?entity2)` and `(compatible ?entity1 ?entity2)`.\n   - The effect `(has_composition ?garlic blended)` maps to `(combined ?entity1 ?entity2)`.\n\n4. **`combine-mix`**:\n   - `?entity1` = ingredients, `?entity2` = bowl contents, `?container` = mixing bowl.\n   - Preconditions and effects align with the general logic of combining entities, ensuring no redundancy.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Adding Cheese to Steak**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action add\n       :parameters (?steak - food ?cheese - food ?plate - dish)\n       :precondition (and (cooked ?steak) (available ?cheese) (compatible ?steak ?cheese) (in ?plate))\n       :effect (and (combined ?steak ?cheese) (not (available ?cheese)) (contained_in ?steak ?plate) (not (plain ?steak)))\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Rubbing Steak with Spice**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action add\n       :parameters (?steak - food ?spice - ingredient ?workspace - surface)\n       :precondition (and (available ?spice) (compatible ?steak ?spice) (not (combined ?steak ?spice)) (in ?workspace))\n       :effect (and (combined ?steak ?spice) (not (available ?spice)) (contained_in ?steak ?workspace) (not (plain ?steak)))\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Mixing Ingredients in a Bowl**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action add\n       :parameters (?garlic - ingredient ?herbs - ingredient ?bowl - object)\n       :precondition (and (available ?herbs) (compatible ?garlic ?herbs) (not (combined ?garlic ?herbs)) (in ?bowl))\n       :effect (and (combined ?garlic ?herbs) (not (available ?herbs)) (contained_in ?garlic ?bowl) (not (plain ?garlic)))\n   )\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Key Benefits of the Merged Action:\n- Handles a wide variety of tasks while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency.\n- Abstracts specific actions into a single, reusable action, reducing redundancy.\n- Clearly reflects state changes, ensuring adaptability to different contexts.",

    "Here is the merged action for the \"brush\" task, following the provided guidelines:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action:\n```pddl\n(:action brush ; Brush an item with another to change their states\n    :parameters (?item1 - object ?item2 - object)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?item1) (modifiable ?item2))\n    :effect (and (enhanced ?item1) (transformed ?item2) (not (modifiable ?item2)))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality**: \n    - The parameters are abstracted as `?item1` and `?item2`, which can represent any objects being used in a \"brush\" action. This increases adaptability for tasks beyond the specific \"sirloin\" and \"butter\" example.\n    - The preconditions and effects are generalized to allow for a variety of state changes (e.g., enhancing one item while transforming another).\n\n2. **State Change**: \n    - The `prepared` precondition ensures the first item (`?item1`) is in a suitable state to be brushed.\n    - The `modifiable` precondition ensures the second item (`?item2`) is in a state that allows it to be used for brushing.\n    - The effects include making the first item \"enhanced\" and the second item \"transformed,\" while also marking the second item as no longer \"modifiable.\"\n\n3. **Simplicity**: \n    - The merged action avoids redundancy by collapsing specific details (e.g., \"sirloin,\" \"cooked,\" \"solid\") into abstract terms like `prepared` and `modifiable`.\n    - The effects are streamlined to capture the essential state changes without overcomplicating the logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: \n    - The action maintains a clear relationship between preconditions and effects, ensuring that the logic is reasonable across different tasks.\n\nThis merged action is adaptable to similar tasks involving brushing, coating, or applying one object to another to produce state changes.",
    "Here\u2019s the merged action for the \"marinate\" task based on your provided examples and the guidelines for combining PDDL actions into a universal form:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: **marinate**\n\n#### Description:\nA generalized action for combining, transforming, or preparing an entity through a marination process, applicable to various objects or entities.\n\n```pddl\n(:action marinate\n    :parameters (?item - entity ?container - location ?modifier - entity)\n    :precondition (and\n        (has_state ?item plain)\n        (at_location ?item ?container) ; Initial container where the item is located\n        (at_location ?modifier origin) ; Initial location where the modifier is located\n        (has_composition ?modifier separated) ; Modifier must be in a usable state\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (not (has_state ?item plain))\n        (has_state ?item marinated) ; The item is now marinated\n        (not (at_location ?item ?container))\n        (at_location ?item target_container) ; Item is moved to a new container post-marination\n        (not (at_location ?modifier origin))\n        (at_location ?modifier target_container) ; Modifier is mixed into the same container\n        (not (has_composition ?modifier separated))\n        (has_composition ?modifier mixed) ; Modifier's state is updated as mixed\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters (`?item`, `?container`, `?modifier`) to ensure applicability to a variety of marination scenarios (e.g., marinating steak, vegetables, or other entities).\n   - Locations (`?container`, `origin`, `target_container`) are generalized to represent any possible starting and ending points for the item and modifier.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The item's state changes from `plain` to `marinated`.\n   - The item's location is updated to a new container (`target_container`), indicating it has been moved as part of the marination process.\n   - The modifier's composition changes from `separated` to `mixed`, representing its transformation during the marination process.\n   - The modifier's location is also updated to the new container, signifying that it was used in the marination process.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the item is in its initial state (`plain`), located in an appropriate starting container, and that the modifier is in a usable state (`separated`) at its original location.\n   - Effects clearly define the transformation of the item's state, the modifier's state, and their locations.\n\n4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - Similar effects (e.g., moving entities, updating states) from the original actions have been merged into a single, cohesive action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different scenarios, ensuring flexibility while maintaining clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Applicability:\nThe merged `marinate` action can now be applied to:\n- Marinating food items (e.g., steak, vegetables) with various marinades.\n- Preparing entities for any process involving a transformation through mixing (e.g., chemical processes, crafting recipes).\n- Any scenario where an item\u2019s state and location are updated through interaction with a modifier.\n\nThis ensures the action is adaptable to a wide range of tasks while maintaining simplicity and logical consistency."

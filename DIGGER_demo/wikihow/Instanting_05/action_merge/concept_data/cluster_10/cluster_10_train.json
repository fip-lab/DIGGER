The precondition `(capable ?npc)` implies the NPC must have the ability or context to engage in the task, ensuring that the action is feasible.",
    "To create a merged action named `market`, we need to consider the generality, state changes, core logic, avoidance of redundancy, and logical consistency of the given actions. Let's create a universal action that can be applied to a variety of tasks related to marketing or integrating new entities into a group or system.\n\n### Merged Action: `market`\n\n```pddl\n(:action market ; Market a group or resource to new entities\n    :parameters (?facilitator - agent ?entity - participant ?group - collective)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?facilitator) (not (integrated ?entity ?group)))\n    :effect (integrated ?entity ?group)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action is named `market` to imply the task of promoting or integrating into a group or system.\n   - Parameters are abstracted to `?facilitator`, `?entity`, and `?group` to cover a wide range of marketing or integration tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the facilitator is prepared and the entity is not yet integrated into the group, which is a general requirement for integration or marketing tasks.\n   - The effect is that the entity becomes integrated into the group, reflecting a successful marketing or integration action.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The precondition `(prepared ?facilitator)` ensures the facilitator is ready for the task.\n   - The precondition `(not (integrated ?entity ?group))` ensures the action only applies to entities not already part of the group.\n   - The effect `(integrated ?entity ?group)` captures the successful completion of the integration or marketing effort.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Similar actions with the same effects are merged into a single action to maintain simplicity and efficiency.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains a clear logical flow with reasonable preconditions and effects applicable across different contexts and tasks.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to various scenarios involving marketing, integration, or onboarding processes, providing a flexible and efficient way to handle these tasks in PDDL."

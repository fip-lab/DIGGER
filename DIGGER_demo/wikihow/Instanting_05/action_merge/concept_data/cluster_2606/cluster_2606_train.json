    "To merge the given action into a single, universal action that follows the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract the parameters and maintain the core logic while ensuring the action is adaptable to various contexts. Here is how the merged action might look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action round ; Round up resources and update organizational status\n  :parameters (?resource - object ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and (disorganized ?resource) (unfinished ?location))\n  :effect (and (organized ?resource) (completed ?location) (not (disorganized ?resource)) (not (unfinished ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?resource` and `?location`, which are of types `object` and `place`, respectively. This allows the action to be applied to a wide variety of tasks involving resources and locations, not just specific equipment or a bedroom.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions and effects clearly reflect a transformation: from `disorganized` to `organized` and from `unfinished` to `completed`. This indicates a change in state from an initial to a goal condition.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single, unified change. It removes unnecessary complexity by focusing on the essential transformation.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** \n   - The logical connection between preconditions and effects is maintained, ensuring that the action remains applicable and valid across different contexts.

Since we only have one action in this case, the primary task is to abstract and generalize it, ensuring it can be applicable in various contexts while maintaining logical consistency.\n\n### Merged Action\n\n```lisp\n(:action transform_visibility ; Transform the visibility and appearance of an object\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?state1 - state ?state2 - state)\n    :precondition (and (entity ?entity) (state ?entity ?state1))\n    :effect (and (not (state ?entity ?state1)) (state ?entity ?state2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters `?entity`, `?state1`, and `?state2` are abstract and can apply to various entities and states beyond just NPCs and visibility. This allows the action to be used in different contexts where an entity's state needs to change from one to another.\n  \n- **State Change**: The precondition ensures that the entity is initially in `?state1`, and the effect transitions it to `?state2`, reflecting a clear state change.\n\n- **Simplicity**: By using abstract parameters and focusing on changing from one state to another, the action avoids unnecessary complexity and is applicable to a range of scenarios.\n\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action only applies when the entity is in the initial state and results in the desired new state. \n\nThis merged action can be adapted to represent transformations like changing visibility, appearance, or any other attribute, given the correct instantiation of parameters.",
    "To merge the given action into a more general and adaptable form, we need to abstract the parameters and broaden the applicability of the action while maintaining the core logic. Here's how the merged action might look:\n\n```pddl\n(:action be\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?location - location ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and (at ?entity ?location))\n    :effect (and (?state ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters have been abstracted to `?entity`, `?location`, and `?state` to increase applicability across various contexts and tasks. This allows the action to be used in scenarios beyond just being amazed on a dance floor.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition checks if the entity is at a specific location, and the effect is to update the entity's state to the specified state, which could be any state relevant to the context (e.g., amazed, impressed, etc.).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - By using abstract parameters and a generic state change, the action avoids redundancy and maintains simplicity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The logical structure of having an entity at a location before a state change is preserved, ensuring that the action remains consistent and reasonable across different tasks."

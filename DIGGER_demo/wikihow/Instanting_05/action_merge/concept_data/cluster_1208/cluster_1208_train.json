For example, `suitable ?item ?context` ensures the item is appropriate for the context, while `context_modified ?context` reflects that the context changes as a result of the action.\n   - `prepped ?tool` ensures the tool is ready for use, and `tool_changed ?tool` indicates that the tool's state has altered (e.g., from clean to dirty).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - By combining similar effects (e.g., moving items, changing states) into more abstract forms, redundancy is minimized.\n   - The action remains simple and efficient, focusing only on the necessary changes.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions ensure logical consistency by requiring that items are possessed, tools are available and prepped, and items are suitable for the context.\n   - The effects clearly define the state changes, ensuring consistency across different scenarios.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single \"peel\" action while adhering to the guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to abstract the actions' parameters and effects, ensuring they can apply to a wide range of tasks involving peeling, curing, and cleaning.

    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"cool,\" we need to identify the common elements across the actions and abstract the parameters to increase generality. The merged action should capture the essence of cooling or transforming an entity's state from a higher energy state to a lower energy state, regardless of the specific entities involved. Here is how the merged action could look:\n\n```lisp\n(:action cool ; Cool an entity and update its state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?location - location)\n  :precondition (and\n    (transformed ?entity)\n    (at ?location active)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (cooled ?entity)\n    (at ?location inactive)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are generalized to `?entity` and `?location` to apply to a variety of objects and locations, whether they are potatoes, meatballs, or other entities.\n   - The action name \"cool\" is chosen to reflect the abstract concept of reducing the temperature or energy state.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(transformed ?entity)` indicates that the entity must have undergone some change (e.g., cooked), which is a common requirement in the given actions before they can be cooled.\n   - The effect `(cooled ?entity)` indicates the primary state change from a transformed state to a cooled one.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain the core logic of requiring an entity to be in a specific state or location before and after the action.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Similar effects such as turning off an oven or setting an entity to room temperature are abstracted into a single effect of cooling the entity and changing the location's state to inactive.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The use of abstract terms like `transformed`, `cooled`, `active`, and `inactive` ensures that the merged action remains logically consistent across different contexts and tasks.\n\nThis universal \"cool\" action can be adapted to various scenarios where an entity needs to be transformed from an active or high-energy state to a cooled or low-energy state.",

    "To create a universal and adaptable PDDL action by merging the given actions, we need to focus on defining a general action that captures the essence of creating or transforming a resource or state. This action will be called `make`, and it should be applicable to a wide variety of tasks by using abstract parameters and maintaining logical consistency. Here's how we can merge the provided actions:\n\n### Universal Action: `make`\n\n```pddl\n(:action make\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?resource - object ?state_before - state ?state_after - state)\n  :precondition (and \n    (has ?actor ?resource) ; The actor has the resource they will work on\n    (state ?resource ?state_before) ; The resource is in the initial state\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (state ?resource ?state_after) ; The resource transitions to the final state\n    (transformed ?resource) ; Mark the resource as transformed or processed\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action `make` is generalized to apply to any situation where an agent (e.g., a person, player) is transforming a resource from one state to another. The parameters are abstract (`?actor`, `?resource`, `?state_before`, `?state_after`) to cover a wide range of tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**: The transition of states is clearly defined from `?state_before` to `?state_after`, ensuring that the necessary conditions are met before and after the action.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is preserved without adding unnecessary complexity. The action captures the essence of transformation tasks.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: By using abstract parameters and a general action structure, redundancy is avoided. The action can accommodate the transformation of different resources (e.g., mixing ingredients, preparing items).\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts. The action requires the resource to be in a specific initial state and results in a well-defined final state, which is logically sound in various scenarios.\n\nThis universal action can be instantiated with specific parameters to cover tasks like making fizzing dough, sour milk cheese, or cooking meatballs, by specifying the appropriate initial and final states for each task.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action named \"shape,\" we need to ensure that the action is abstract, adaptable, and captures the transformation of an entity's state.

This increases its applicability across various tasks.\n- **State Change:** The precondition checks if the entity is visible and modifiable within a certain context, reflecting the state that allows transformation. The effect transforms the entity into a camouflaged and invisible state, showing the desired state change.\n- **Simplicity:** The action is simplified by using generic parameters and focusing only on the essential preconditions and effects needed for the transformation.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects by ensuring that only entities that are both visible and modifiable can be transformed, preserving logical consistency across different scenarios.",

This allows it to be used for saving any object to a suitable location or state.\n   \n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action has a clear state change, where the entity is transformed from an unstored state to a stored state and pending status is removed, reflecting the completion of the action.\n   \n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the entity is not already stored in the target and that the target is suitable for storing. The effects update the state to indicate the entity is now stored and no longer pending.\n   \n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Actions with similar effects and purposes are merged into this universal \"save\" action, reducing redundancy and simplifying the PDDL representation.\n   \n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains logical consistency across different tasks, with preconditions and effects that are reasonable and adaptable to various contexts. \n\nBy following these principles, the merged \"save\" action can be applied to tasks like saving yolks in a container, gathering chicks, or any similar task involving storing entities and updating their status.",

This generality allows the action to adapt to various freezing tasks, whether it involves yolks or meatballs.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the change in state. Preconditions require the entity to be stored in a suitable container and prepared for freezing. The effects ensure the entity is frozen, not liquid (if applicable), and stored in the appropriate frozen storage location.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundant conditions are removed, and the action is streamlined to include only essential elements. For example, both actions involved freezing, so the `frozen` effect is central. The location aspect is generalized with `stored_at` to indicate a change in storage state.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical preconditions that are reasonable across contexts. It checks for suitability and preparation before freezing, ensuring the action's effects are consistent with its prerequisites.\n\nThis universal action can be applied to various items and contexts, fulfilling the requirement for a merged action that aligns with the provided guidelines.",

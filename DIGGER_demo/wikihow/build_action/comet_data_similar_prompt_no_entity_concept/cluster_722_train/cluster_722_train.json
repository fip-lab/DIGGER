About 12 inches (30 cm) of papyrus plant will make a large piece of paper that will be nearly 24 inches (61 cm) in length. Cut off as many stalks as you will need to make the amount of paper you want. The cuts must be diagonally made. Then, cut the tips of the papyrus. You will not use the tips, which are the thinner, grass-like end of the plant.\n- Weave the strips together. Lay the strips on the cloth. Get a dry sheet of linen cloth or felt. Then, begin to weave them together. You want to create 2 layers of strips, with the top layer strips being perpendicular to the bottom layer strips. It should resemble a placemat. The strips should slightly overlap one another to prevent the papyrus from falling apart later.\n- Roll the excess water and sugar out of the plant. Grab a rolling pin and use it to roll the strips flat. The rolling pin should be squeezing the water out of them and flattening the strips into sheets.\n- Cut the paper. The sheet may be larger than you want when it is finished. Use a razor, scissors, or paper cutter to cut the papyrus into smaller sheets. Measure the sizes you are cutting so you will have multiple sheets of the same size.\n- Cut up the inner portion into strips. Use the knife you used to cut off the outer portion to cut the inner layers of the papyrus plant (pith) into thin strips. Hold the plant in your hand and cut towards you vertically. Make sure that all of the strips have the same size and thickness.\n- Place the bundle between 2 wooden boards. Make sure that the wooden boards are somewhat heavy. The pressure is necessary to flatten the papyrus strips together. Once the strips have been placed between the boards, press them together. Lay the sandwiched papyrus sheet on a flat surface and allow the wooden boards to flatten the sheet using gravity.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n(:action roll_strips; roll the excess water and sugar out of the strips to dry them\n    :parameters (?p - player ?rolling_pin - rolling_pin ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?rolling_pin) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (soaked ?papyrus_strips))\n    :effect (dried ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action soak_strips; place papyrus strips in water and let them soak\n    :parameters (?p - player ?water - water ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?water) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips))\n    :effect (soaked ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action weave_strips; weave the dried papyrus strips into a lattice\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (dried ?papyrus_strips))\n    :effect (woven ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action bundle_strips; bundle the woven strips between linen sheets and wooden boards\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips ?wooden_boards - wooden_boards ?linen_sheets - linen_sheets)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (woven ?papyrus_strips) (inventory ?p ?wooden_boards) (inventory ?p ?linen_sheets))\n    :effect (finished ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action cut_sheet; the finished sheet is cut to size to complete the papyrus\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips ?knife - knife ?papyrus - papyrus)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (finished ?papyrus_strips) (inventory ?p ?knife))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus) (not (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips)))\n  )\n)\n(:action cut_stalks; cut papyrus plant into stalks\n    :parameters (?p - player ?knife - knife ?papyrus_plant - papyrus_plant ?papyrus_stalks - papyrus_stalks)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?knife) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_plant))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_stalks) (not (inventory ?p ?papyrus_plant)))\n  )\n(:action cut_strips; cut papyrus stalks into strips\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips ?papyrus_stalks - papyrus_stalks ?knife - knife)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?knife) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_stalks))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (not (inventory ?p ?papyrus_stalks)))\n  )\n\nYour Task:\nNow, generate PDDL actions based on the following new task and steps:\nTask: How to Treat Ovarian Cysts\n\nSteps:\n- monitor_painter npc\n- check_symptoms ovarian_customies\n- be_informed npc\n- schedule_check npc\n\nDescriptions:\n- Monitor pelvic pain.\n- Look for other symptoms of ovarian cysts.\n- Be aware of the risk factors.\n- Schedule a doctor’s appointment.\n\nIf a step is irrelevant to the task or description, or appears to be wrong, modify it to be relevant to the step and generate task-specific PDDL actions.\nGenerate the PDDL actions using the format and structure shown in the example.",

About 12 inches (30 cm) of papyrus plant will make a large piece of paper that will be nearly 24 inches (61 cm) in length. Cut off as many stalks as you will need to make the amount of paper you want. The cuts must be diagonally made. Then, cut the tips of the papyrus. You will not use the tips, which are the thinner, grass-like end of the plant.\n- Weave the strips together. Lay the strips on the cloth. Get a dry sheet of linen cloth or felt. Then, begin to weave them together. You want to create 2 layers of strips, with the top layer strips being perpendicular to the bottom layer strips. It should resemble a placemat. The strips should slightly overlap one another to prevent the papyrus from falling apart later.\n- Roll the excess water and sugar out of the plant. Grab a rolling pin and use it to roll the strips flat. The rolling pin should be squeezing the water out of them and flattening the strips into sheets.\n- Cut the paper. The sheet may be larger than you want when it is finished. Use a razor, scissors, or paper cutter to cut the papyrus into smaller sheets. Measure the sizes you are cutting so you will have multiple sheets of the same size.\n- Cut up the inner portion into strips. Use the knife you used to cut off the outer portion to cut the inner layers of the papyrus plant (pith) into thin strips. Hold the plant in your hand and cut towards you vertically. Make sure that all of the strips have the same size and thickness.\n- Place the bundle between 2 wooden boards. Make sure that the wooden boards are somewhat heavy. The pressure is necessary to flatten the papyrus strips together. Once the strips have been placed between the boards, press them together. Lay the sandwiched papyrus sheet on a flat surface and allow the wooden boards to flatten the sheet using gravity.\n\nPDDL Actions:\n(:action roll_strips; roll the excess water and sugar out of the strips to dry them\n    :parameters (?p - player ?rolling_pin - rolling_pin ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?rolling_pin) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (soaked ?papyrus_strips))\n    :effect (dried ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action soak_strips; place papyrus strips in water and let them soak\n    :parameters (?p - player ?water - water ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?water) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips))\n    :effect (soaked ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action weave_strips; weave the dried papyrus strips into a lattice\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (dried ?papyrus_strips))\n    :effect (woven ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action bundle_strips; bundle the woven strips between linen sheets and wooden boards\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips ?wooden_boards - wooden_boards ?linen_sheets - linen_sheets)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (woven ?papyrus_strips) (inventory ?p ?wooden_boards) (inventory ?p ?linen_sheets))\n    :effect (finished ?papyrus_strips)\n  )\n(:action cut_sheet; the finished sheet is cut to size to complete the papyrus\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips ?knife - knife ?papyrus - papyrus)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (finished ?papyrus_strips) (inventory ?p ?knife))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus) (not (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips)))\n  )\n)\n(:action cut_stalks; cut papyrus plant into stalks\n    :parameters (?p - player ?knife - knife ?papyrus_plant - papyrus_plant ?papyrus_stalks - papyrus_stalks)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?knife) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_plant))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_stalks) (not (inventory ?p ?papyrus_plant)))\n  )\n(:action cut_strips; cut papyrus stalks into strips\n    :parameters (?p - player ?papyrus_strips - papyrus_strips ?papyrus_stalks - papyrus_stalks ?knife - knife)\n    :precondition (and (inventory ?p ?knife) (inventory ?p ?papyrus_stalks))\n    :effect (and (inventory ?p ?papyrus_strips) (not (inventory ?p ?papyrus_stalks)))\n  )\n\nYour Task:\nNow, generate PDDL actions based on the following new task and steps:\nTask: How to Shrink Hemorrhoids\n\nSteps:\n- get_medical_attached_with_lemon npc\n- listen_to_doctor you doctor\n- be_injured person bathroom npc\n\nDescriptions:\n- Seek medical attention for severe hemorrhoids.\n- Discuss non-surgical treatment options with your doctor.\n- Consider having a hemorrhoidectomy.\n\nIf a step is irrelevant to the task or description, or appears to be wrong, modify it to be relevant to the step and generate task-specific PDDL actions.\nGenerate the PDDL actions using the format and structure shown in the example.",

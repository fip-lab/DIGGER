A secret society must have something to protect.\n- Conduct a proper initiation for you and your closest friend. This should be done before you initiate others. That way, you are sure to come up with a good idea. The initiation is one of the most important parts of the society. It has to be something neither of you would do normally. Candle-lighting sets a serious and official tone, which is always good. Secret names are fun to have.\n- An important thing in secret societies is to meet in secret, that means meeting in a new place every time or having access to a secret room somewhere. You could even figure out a time to chat online.\n- Initiate well to do people in the society. In a school, initiate the most brilliant and enthusiastic students that seem like clique-material, and they will motivate and inspire others. But you don't want to have too many members. The more members, the less secret it is. Five to ten should be good.\n- Read a few clique-like books, like the clique series by Lisi Harrison, for some background information, although, maybe not so mean like they were.\n- Make a dress code. Most small secret societies use robes while large ones, like the Freemasons, have complex aprons.\n- Think of a name.

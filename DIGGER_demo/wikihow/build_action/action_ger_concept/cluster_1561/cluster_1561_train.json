Below are the PDDL actions that capture the essence of the task:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Cut or Bend Coat Hanger for Wings\n(:action cut_or_bend_coathanger\n    :parameters (?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (not (bent ?h))\n    :effect (bent ?h)\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Make Three-Pronged Shapes\n(:action make_three_pronged_shapes\n    :parameters (?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (bent ?h)\n    :effect (three_pronged_shape ?h)\n)\n\n;; Action 3: Twist Wicks Together\n(:action twist_wicks_together\n    :parameters (?w1 - wick ?w2 - wick)\n    :precondition (and (not (twisted ?w1 ?w2))\n                       (separate ?w1)\n                       (separate ?w2))\n    :effect (and (twisted ?w1 ?w2)\n                 (not (separate ?w1))\n                 (not (separate ?w2)))\n)\n\n;; Action 4: Cut Fabric for Wing Shape\n(:action cut_fabric_for_wing_shape\n    :parameters (?f - fabric ?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (three_pronged_shape ?h)\n    :effect (cut_to_shape ?f ?h)\n)\n\n;; Action 5: Secure Fabric Around Frame\n(:action secure_fabric_around_frame\n    :parameters (?f - fabric ?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (cut_to_shape ?f ?h)\n    :effect (secured ?f ?h)\n)\n\n;; Action 6: Pad Twisted Wires with Fabric\n(:action pad_twisted_wires\n    :parameters (?f - fabric ?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (secured ?f ?h)\n    :effect (padded ?h)\n)\n\n;; Action 7: Fit Child with Elastic Straps\n(:action fit_child_with_elastic\n    :parameters (?c - child ?e - elastic)\n    :precondition (not (fitted ?c ?e))\n    :effect (fitted ?c ?e)\n)\n\n;; Action 8: Sew Wings to Elastic Straps\n(:action sew_wings_to_elastic\n    :parameters (?h - coathanger ?e - elastic)\n    :precondition (and (padded ?h)\n                       (fitted ?c ?e))\n    :effect (sewn ?h ?e)\n)\n\n;; Action 9: Cut Triangles for Ears\n(:action cut_triangles_for_ears\n    :parameters (?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (bent ?h)\n    :effect (triangular_shape ?h)\n)\n\n;; Action 10: Cover Ears with Fabric\n(:action cover_ears_with_fabric\n    :parameters (?f - fabric ?h - coathanger)\n    :precondition (triangular_shape ?h)\n    :effect (covered ?h ?f)\n)\n\n;; Action 11: Sew Ears to Headband\n(:action sew_ears_to_headband\n    :parameters (?h - coathanger ?b - headband)\n    :precondition (covered ?h ?f)\n    :effect (attached ?h ?b)\n)\n```\n\nThis set of PDDL actions represents the steps involved in creating a child's bat costume, capturing the essential state changes for each entity involved. The actions include bending coat hangers, cutting and securing fabric, and assembling the costume parts to ensure a coherent and complete costume-making process.",
    "Based on the task \"How to Make a Fairy for the Christmas Tree\" and the provided steps, here are the PDDL actions that capture the intent, logic, and state changes of each step:\n\n```lisp\n;; Action 1: Build materials\n(:action build_materials\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?w - work_station ?s - sheet)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (assembled ?n))\n                    (available ?w)\n                    (not (crumpled ?s))\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (assembled ?n)\n              (crumpled ?s)\n            )\n)\n\n;; Action 2: Fold and flatten sheet\n(:action fold_and_flatten_sheet\n    :parameters (?p - paper)\n    :precondition (not (folded ?p))\n    :effect (folded ?p)\n)\n\n;; Action 3: Cut branch\n(:action cut_branch\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?sc - scissors)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (attached ?sc)\n                    (not (cut ?sc))\n                  )\n    :effect (cut ?sc)\n)\n\n;; Action 4: Bend to shape wire\n(:action bend_to_shape_wire\n    :parameters (?n - npc)\n    :precondition (not (bent ?n))\n    :effect (bent ?n)\n)\n\n;; Action 5: Attach to paper\n(:action attach_to_paper\n    :parameters (?n - npc ?c - covering_tracks ?t - track)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (not (attached ?c))\n                    (jerky ?t)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (attached ?c)\n              (smooth ?t)\n            )\n)\n\n;; Action 6: Wind wand\n(:action wind_wand\n    :parameters (?w - wick1)\n    :precondition (not (wound ?w))\n    :effect (wound ?w)\n)\n\n;; Action 7: Make bodice\n(:action make_bodice\n    :parameters (?e - my_equipment)\n    :precondition (not (organized ?e))\n    :effect (organized ?e)\n)\n\n;; Action 8: Make fairy wings\n(:action make_fairy_wings\n    :parameters (?w - fairy_wings)\n    :precondition (not (fortified ?w))\n    :effect (fortified ?w)\n)\n\n;; Action 9: Place fairy on tree\n(:action place_fairy_on_tree\n    :parameters (?o - on_tree ?n - npc ?f - fairy)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (bare ?f)\n                    (elsewhere ?o)\n                  )\n    :effect (and\n              (decorated ?f)\n              (on_webbing ?o)\n            )\n)\n\n;; Action 10: Finish wreath\n(:action finish_wreath\n    :parameters (?w - wreath)\n    :precondition (in_progress ?w)\n    :effect (completed ?w)\n)\n```\n\nThese PDDL actions reflect the task's steps and focus on the relevant state changes for each entity involved.

The steak must be on the kitchen counter, and a clean knife must be available. After the action, the steak becomes `cut_open`, and the knife becomes dirty.\n\n2. **Action 2: `check_doneness`**\n   - This action involves checking the doneness of the steak using the finger test. The steak must already be cut open, and a clean hand is required. After the action, the steak's `doneness_checked` state is updated.\n\n3. **Action 3: `check_meat`**\n   - This action involves checking the firmness of the steak to estimate doneness. The steak must have its doneness already checked, and a clean hand is required. After the action, the steak's `firmness_checked` state is updated.\n\n4. **Action 4: `make_signal`**\n   - This action represents making a signal (e.g., telling an NPC or marking the steak) to indicate the steak's doneness. The steak must have its firmness checked, and the NPC must be present at the kitchen counter. After the action, the `signal_made` state is updated to reflect that the steak's doneness has been communicated.\n\nThese actions capture the logical flow and state transitions required to complete the task of determining if the steak is done.",

The steak must already be \"covered,\" and the fridge must be accessible. After the action, the steak's state changes to \"in_fridge.\"\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- The irrelevant steps (e.g., \"rub_with_ingredients beef_cooked beef\") were adjusted to fit the task of preparing kangaroo steak.\n- Task-specific states such as `rubbed`, `submerged`, `in_bowl`, `covered`, and `in_fridge` were introduced to reflect the entity state transitions described in the task.\n- The actions follow the structure and logic of the example provided, ensuring consistency and clarity.\n\n",

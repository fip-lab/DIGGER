The precondition checks if the diapers are dirty, and the effect changes their state to clean.\n\n2. **lay_diapers_flat**:\n   - Lays the diapers flat with stains facing up in a sunny location. The precondition ensures the diapers are clean and the location is sunny, and the effect updates their state to laid flat.\n\n3. **line_dry_diapers**:\n   - Line-dries the diapers or places them on a drying rack in the sun. The precondition ensures the diapers are laid flat in a sunny location, and the effect updates their state to line-dried.\n\n4. **spray_lemon_juice**:\n   - Sprays lemon juice onto the stains for bleaching. The precondition ensures the player has lemon juice in their inventory and the diapers are laid flat, and the effect marks the stains as treated.\n\n5. **bring_diapers_in**:\n   - Brings the diapers inside after sun exposure. The precondition ensures the diapers are line-dried, and the effect moves them to the home location.\n\n6. **repeat_bleaching_process**:\n   - Repeats the bleaching process for stubborn stains. The precondition checks if the diapers have stubborn stains, and the effect lays them flat again and treats the stains.\n\n7. **throw_in_dryer**:\n   - Dries the diapers in a dryer to finish the process. The precondition ensures the diapers are at the dryer location, and the effect changes their state to dry.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made:\n- Steps like \"choose_amazing\" and \"blend_with_cloth\" were irrelevant or unclear and were omitted.\n- The steps were aligned with the task description to ensure logical and relevant actions.\n- Each action reflects the specific state changes required to complete the task (e.g., clean, laid_flat, line_dried, stains_treated, dry).\n\nLet me know if further refinements are needed!",

These were adjusted to focus on adding detergent and bleach to the machine, as described in the task.\n   - `run_washer_with_machine washer1 bike1 oil1` was rewritten to focus on running the washer with the correct cycle and machine setup.\n   - `finish-wreath wreath` was replaced with a final action to indicate the completion of the bleaching process.\n\n2. **Entity State Transitions:**\n   - The state transitions for the washer, machine, water, detergent, bleach, and clothing were carefully tracked. For instance, the washer transitions to a \"running\" state during the cycle and stops running after the process is complete. Clothing transitions to a \"bleached\" state after the process.\n\n3. **Task-Specific States:**\n   - Relevant states such as `washer_set_to`, `contains`, `washer_running`, and `bleached` were introduced to capture the key aspects of the bleaching process.\n\nThis ensures that the generated PDDL actions accurately reflect the task and its requirements.",

The state `determined_agent` is introduced to ensure the agent is chosen before proceeding.\n\n2. **Blend the wood (`blend_wood`)**:\n   - This action assumes that blending the wood is a necessary step in the process. The state `blended` is used to track whether the wood has been prepared.\n\n3. **Clean the wood (`clean_wood`)**:\n   - This action rinses and prepares the wood (and optionally the log) for neutralization. The state `clean` ensures that the wood is ready for the next step.\n\n4. **Mix the neutralizer (`mix_neutralizer`)**:\n   - This action involves preparing the neutralizing agent in a mixing bowl. The state `neutralizer_ready` ensures the neutralizer is properly mixed before application.\n\n5. **Apply the neutralizing agent (`apply_neutralizing_agent`)**:\n   - This action applies the prepared neutralizer to the wood. The state `neutralized` tracks whether the wood has been successfully neutralized.\n\n### Notes:\n- The steps have been adjusted to align with the task's intent and ensure logical progression.\n- Preconditions and effects reflect the changes in the state of entities (e.g., wood, neutralizer) as they transition through the process.\n- If any additional details about the task are provided, the actions can be further refined.",

These were adjusted to align with the task description (e.g., creating a paste and applying it to the skin).\n\n2. **Entity States**:\n   - Relevant states for entities were identified, such as `grated`, `contains`, `paste_ready`, `darkened`, `lightened`, and `clean`. These states reflect the progression of the task from preparing the paste to applying it and achieving the desired skin-lightening effect.\n\n3. **Action Logic**:\n   - Each action's preconditions and effects were carefully crafted to reflect the state transitions described in the task. For example, the `apply_paste_to_skin` action requires the paste to be ready and the skin to be darkened, and its effect is that the skin becomes lightened and the tool becomes dirty.\n\n4. **Repeat Treatment**:\n   - A final action, `repeat_treatment`, was added to reflect the recommendation to use the treatment weekly until the skin is fully lightened.\n\nThis set of PDDL actions captures the intent and logic of the task while ensuring accurate state transitions for all entities involved.",

The state of the wick changes from `unprepared` to `prepared`.\n\n2. **`put_gens_in_machine`**:\n   - This step was adjusted to involve loading a machine with `gens`, as \"put_gens_in_machine\" was not directly relevant to bleaching paper but was interpreted as a preparatory action. The state of the machine changes from `empty` to `loaded`.\n\n3. **`hold_ink_stained_paper`**:\n   - Captures the action of holding ink-stained paper, necessary for subsequent washing. The state of the paper changes to indicate it is being held and no longer just `ink_stained`.\n\n4. **`wash_paper`**:\n   - Models the washing of the paper in acetone. The paper becomes `washed` and is placed on a `paper_towel` surface. The acetone is assumed to be ready as a precondition.\n\n5. **`let_paper_wicks_open`**:\n   - Represents the drying step where the paper is left to air dry. The state of the paper transitions from `wet` to `dry`.\n\n### Notes:\n- The actions were adjusted to reflect the logical flow of the task and ensure alignment with the descriptions provided.\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps were modified to better fit the task context (e.g., the role of \"gens\" was inferred as a preparatory step for the machine).\n- The states `ink_stained`, `washed`, `wet`, and `dry` were used to track the progression of the paper through the bleaching process.\n- Preconditions and effects ensure that each action logically follows the previous one and reflects the changes in the state of entities involved.",

For example, \"set_heat_level stove_knob velveeta\" was adapted to represent setting the tone or intensity of the romance books, as \"stove_knob\" and \"velveeta\" do not directly relate to the task.\n- Steps like \"ask_for_suggestions\" were generalized to fit the context of a book club activity.\n- Irrelevant or unclear steps were omitted or rephrased to fit the task's intent.\n\nThis set of PDDL actions should provide a structured way to model the task of starting and running a romance book club.",

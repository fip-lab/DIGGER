The effect marks the blanket as \"inspected.\"\n\n4. **take_care**: This action represents taking care of the blanket at the laundromat. The precondition ensures that the blanket has been inspected and is at the laundromat with the NPC. The effect marks the blanket as \"cared_for.\"\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n\n- The step \"do not dry clean your electric blanket\" and \"do not iron an electric blanket\" are not represented as actions because they are prohibitions rather than explicit steps to perform. However, these constraints can be encoded in the domain model by ensuring no actions for \"dry cleaning\" or \"ironing\" exist.\n\n- The step \"make_oven npc cordial\" was interpreted as \"make cordial\" and included as a supportive action.\n\n- The PDDL actions focus on the relevant state changes of the electric blanket and the NPC's interactions with it.\n\n",

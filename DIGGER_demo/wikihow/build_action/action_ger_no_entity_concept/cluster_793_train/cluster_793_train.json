The precondition ensures the person does not already have the lamp, and the effect adds the lamp to their possession and marks it as high quality.\n\n2. **`get_salt_lamp`**: This action ensures the user has a properly set up and sufficiently large salt lamp. The precondition checks that the user has a lamp but not one that is big enough, and the effect ensures the lamp is now \"big enough\" and properly set up with a salt light.\n\n3. **`watch_for_copious_sweating`**: This action involves monitoring the salt lamp for excessive sweating or moisture. The precondition checks if the lamp has not been checked for sweating, and the effect ensures it has been checked and confirms there is no copious sweating.\n\n4. **`clean_lamp`**: This action cleans the lamp to remove any buildup. The precondition ensures that the lamp has buildup, and the effect removes the buildup and marks the lamp as clean.\n\n5. **`use_as_salt_candle_holder`**: This action allows the user to use the Himalayan salt lamp as a candle holder. The precondition ensures the lamp is in possession, big enough, and clean. The effect marks the lamp as being used as a candle holder.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments Made\n- The irrelevant or unclear steps (e.g., \"watch_for_copious_sweating person water\") were clarified to align with the task description (e.g., monitoring for excess moisture from the lamp).\n- Actions were designed to reflect the state changes central to the task, such as possession of the lamp, its size, cleanliness, and usage as a candle holder.\n- The logic ensures that each step contributes meaningfully to the overall task of using Himalayan salt lamps effectively.",

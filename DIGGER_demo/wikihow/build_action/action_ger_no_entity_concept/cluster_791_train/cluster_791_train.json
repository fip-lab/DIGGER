For example, \"add oil to fridge\" was modified to \"add oil to orange,\" as this makes sense in the context of the task.\n\n2. **Entity State Transitions**: Each action defines preconditions and effects that reflect the logical transitions of the orange, wick, and other entities involved in the task. For example:\n   - The orange transitions from `prepared` to `cut`, then from `cut` to `peeled`.\n   - The wick transitions from `not located` to `located`, and then to being placed in the orange.\n\n3. **Action Parameters**: The parameters include relevant objects and agents (e.g., orange, wick, tools, agents) to ensure the actions are well-scoped.\n\n4. **Task-Specific Adjustments**: Some steps, like \"make_sliplargerbeads,\" were slightly modified to fit the task's context (e.g., adjusting beads on the orange).\n\n5. **Logical Flow**: The sequence of actions ensures the candle-making process is logical and complete, from preparing the orange to lighting the candle.\n\nThis PDDL representation captures the intent and state transitions for each step in the task.",

Tracks the bowl's location and temperature.\n\n6. **`prepare-container`**: Prepares the container by pouring the melted chocolate and wax combination into it. Tracks the container's fullness and the chocolate's location.\n\n7. **`check-wicks`**: Ensures the wicks are ready for use. Updates the wick's state to \"ready.\"\n\n8. **`wait-until-sets`**: Waits for the candle to set. Updates the container's state to \"set.\"\n\n9. **`get-chocolates`**: Final action where the candle is complete and ready for enjoyment. Tracks the chocolate's location as \"in-candle\" and the candle's state as \"ready-to-enjoy.\"\n\nThis set of actions captures the task's intent, logic, and state transitions comprehensively.",

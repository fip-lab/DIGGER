The precondition checks that the nail is buffed and the person has an alcohol wipe. The wipe is consumed after use.\n\n3. **apply_gel_polish_foundation**: Applies a gel polish foundation to the cleaned nail. The precondition ensures the nail is clean and the person has the gel polish. The effect is that the foundation is applied.\n\n4. **cure_foundation**: Cures the gel polish foundation under a UV or LED lamp. The precondition ensures the foundation is applied and the person has access to a lamp. The effect is that the foundation is cured.\n\n5. **apply_regular_nail_polish**: Applies regular (non-gel) nail polish on top of the cured foundation. The precondition checks that the foundation is cured and the person has regular nail polish. The effect is that the regular polish is applied.\n\n6. **dry_regular_polish**: Dries the applied regular nail polish. The precondition ensures that the regular polish is applied. The effect is that the polish becomes dried.\n\n7. **apply_gel_topcoat**: Applies a gel topcoat over the dried regular polish. The precondition checks that the regular polish is dried and the person has the gel topcoat. The effect is that the topcoat is applied.\n\n8. **cure_topcoat**: Cures the gel topcoat under a UV or LED lamp. The precondition ensures the topcoat is applied and the person has access to a lamp. The effect is that the topcoat is cured.\n\n9. **wipe_tacky_layer_with_alcohol**: Removes the tacky layer from the cured gel topcoat using an alcohol wipe. The precondition checks that the topcoat is cured and the person has an alcohol wipe. The wipe is consumed, and the nail is no longer tacky.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Exclusions\n\n- Irrelevant steps like \"remove_tape\" and \"cure-wound\" were excluded as they do not align with the task description.\n- Actions were renamed or rephrased to better reflect the described steps (e.g., \"wipe_tape_with_alcohol_clean\" was adjusted to \"wipe_tacky_layer_with_alcohol\").\n- The entity states (e.g., `clean`, `buffed`, `foundation_cured`) were chosen to capture the specific transitions described in the task.\n\nThis set of actions accurately models the process of using both regular and UV gel nail polish together.",
    "Based on the task description and the provided steps, I will generate PDDL actions for the task \"How to Open Nail Polish.\" I will ensure the actions align with the task's intent and focus on the state changes of relevant entities.

Preconditions ensure the bottle is not stuck, and effects reflect the bottle's state change from closed to opened.\n\n2. **set_cap_on_counter**: Adjusted to make sense in the context of the task. The user places the cap on a counter to free up the bottle for further actions.\n\n3. **wrap_rubber_band**: This step is relevant as it improves grip on the cap, which helps in loosening it. The action reflects the state change of the cap being wrapped with a rubber band.\n\n4. **dissolve_polish**: This step aligns with the description of using nail polish thinner to dissolve hardened polish. Preconditions ensure the bottle is stuck, and effects reflect its unstuck state.\n\n5. **soften_stick**: This action uses hot water to soften the polish, aligning with the description. Preconditions ensure the bottle is stuck, and effects reflect its unstuck state.\n\n---\n\n### Notes\n- Irrelevant or incorrect steps (e.g., \"set_cap_on_counter user1 ketchup_bottle1\" and \"wrap_rubber_band user1 velveeta\") were adjusted to fit the context of the task.\n- The actions focus on state changes such as `stuck`, `opened`, `closed`, and the use of tools like rubber bands, thinner, and hot water.\n- Actions are modular, allowing for flexibility in planning and execution."

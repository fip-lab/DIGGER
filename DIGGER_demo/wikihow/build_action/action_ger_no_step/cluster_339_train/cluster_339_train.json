Since the steps and some entity states are incomplete or ambiguous, I will infer and adjust them to be relevant to the task. Here's the PDDL output:\n\n---\n\n### PDDL Actions for \"How to Wash an Electric Blanket\"\n\n#### 1. Inspect Electric Blanket\n(:action inspect_blanket\n   :parameters (?blanket - electric_blanket ?p - player)\n   :precondition (and (at ?p home) (has ?p ?blanket) (not (damaged ?blanket)))\n   :effect (inspected ?blanket)\n)\n\n#### 2. Wash Electric Blanket\n(:action wash_blanket\n   :parameters (?blanket - electric_blanket ?machine - washing_machine ?p - player)\n   :precondition (and (at ?p laundromat) (has ?p ?blanket) (usable ?machine) (not (damaged ?blanket)))\n   :effect (and (washed ?blanket) (not (dirty ?blanket)))\n)\n\n#### 3.

Inspect Blanket After Washing and Drying\n(:action inspect_after_wash\n   :parameters (?blanket - electric_blanket ?p - player)\n   :precondition (and (at ?p home) (has ?p ?blanket) (dry ?blanket) (not (damaged ?blanket)))\n   :effect (inspected_after_wash ?blanket)\n)\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Explanations:\n1. **Irrelevant Steps Removed:** The provided descriptions about \"not dry cleaning\" and \"not ironing\" were not actionable steps but rather warnings. These were omitted from action generation since they do not involve direct actions.\n2. **Entity States:** The entity states provided (e.g., helmet, visibility, etc.) seem unrelated to the task of washing an electric blanket. These were not used in the PDDL actions, as they do not pertain to the task.\n3. **Player and Location:** The actions assume a player (?p) performing the task at specific locations (e.g., home, laundromat), which is inferred as necessary for the task.\n\nIf the task steps or entity states are refined further, I can adapt the PDDL actions accordingly.",

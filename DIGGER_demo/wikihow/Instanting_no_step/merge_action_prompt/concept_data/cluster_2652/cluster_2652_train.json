The precondition ensures the player is in the correct location and the area has commercial composting facilities. The effect updates the player's knowledge about the availability of composting facilities.\n\n---\n\n#### Action 2: Setup_Underground_Compost\n```lisp\n\n(:action check-compost-temperature\n    :parameters (?t - tumbler)\n    :precondition (and (in ?t) (mixed ?t))\n    :effect (and (warm ?t))\n)\n```\n\n#### **8.

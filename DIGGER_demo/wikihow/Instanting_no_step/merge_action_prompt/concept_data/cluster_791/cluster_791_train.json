The effect tracks that the candle is now in the measuring cup and no longer in its original form.\n\n2. **Melt the wax in a pan of boiling water**: This action describes melting the wax by placing the measuring cup in a pan with boiling water. The precondition ensures the wax is in the measuring cup and the pan contains boiling water. The effect updates the wax state to \"melted.\"\n\n3. **Place the wicks inside the shot glasses**: This action involves placing wicks into empty shot glasses. The precondition ensures the wick is intact and the shot glass is empty.

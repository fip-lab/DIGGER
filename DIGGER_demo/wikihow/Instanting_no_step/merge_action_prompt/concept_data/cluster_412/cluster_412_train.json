The precondition checks that the player has water in their inventory, the soil is dry, and the player is at the tree's location. The effect updates the soil to a \"wet\" state and removes the water from the inventory.\n\n2. **Remove the Topsoil**: This step involves removing the topsoil to expose the roots. Preconditions ensure the soil is wet (from the previous step) and the tree is at the location. The effect marks the topsoil as removed.\n\n3. **Dig the Roots**: Digging the roots requires a spade. Preconditions ensure the player has a spade in their inventory, the topsoil is removed, and the player is at the tree's location. The effect marks the roots as dug.\n\n4. **Remove the Root Ball**: The final step involves digging underneath the root ball and pulling it out. Preconditions ensure the roots are dug, the player has a spade, and the player is at the tree's location. The effect removes the tree from the location and marks the root ball as removed.\n\n---\n\nThis PDDL captures the logical flow of the task \"How to Remove a Tree\" while adhering to the provided descriptions and entity states.\n(:action remove_topsoil\n    :parameters (?p - player ?tree - tree ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (at ?tree ?loc) (wet_soil ?loc) (not (topsoil_removed ?tree)))\n    :effect (and (topsoil_removed ?tree)))\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Dig the roots out with a spade.\n```lisp\n\n(:action remove_stake\n    :parameters (?p - player ?tree - bare_root_tree ?stake - stake ?hole - hole)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?hole) (staked ?tree) (time_elapsed ?tree 1_year))\n    :effect (and (not (staked ?tree)) (at ?stake ?p))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- Each action is designed to follow the task's logical progression and ensure the preconditions and effects align with the provided descriptions and entity states.\n- Steps irrelevant to the task or ambiguous were omitted or adjusted to fit the context of planting a bare root tree.\n- Actions like \"water_tree\" are designed to be repeatable until the tree is sufficiently watered.\n(:action remove_rootstock_branch\n    :parameters (?p - player ?rootstock - plant ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?loc) (cut_above_bud ?rootstock) (new_leaves ?bud))\n    :effect (and (not (rootstock_branch_remaining ?rootstock)) (fully_grafted ?rootstock ?bud))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Generated Actions:\n1. **Plant Rootstock:** Plants the rootstock in suitable soil.\n2. **Prepare Graft:** Ensures conditions are suitable for grafting.\n3. **Make T-Cut:** Creates a T-shaped cut in the rootstock plant.\n4. **Cut Scion Bud:** Cuts a healthy bud from the scion plant.\n5. **Insert Bud:** Inserts the scion bud into the T-cut of the rootstock.\n6. **Tie Plants:** Ties the rootstock and scion bud together with binding material.\n7. **Wait for Healing:** Waits for the graft site to heal.\n8. **Cut Above Bud:** Cuts the rootstock branch above the grafted bud.\n9. **Remove Rootstock Branch:** Removes the remaining rootstock branch once the bud has grown.\n\nThese actions follow the logical sequence of grafting plants and incorporate the necessary conditions and effects for each step.\n(:action remove_container\n    :parameters (?p - player ?tree - tree ?container - container)\n    :precondition (and (at ?p ?tree) (in_container ?tree ?container))\n    :effect (and (not (in_container ?tree ?container)) (exposed ?tree))\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 6: Check Circling Roots\n```pddl\n\n(:action prune_kumquat_stems\n    :parameters (?tree - kumquat ?p - player ?loc - location)\n    :precondition (and (at ?tree ?loc) (at ?p ?loc) (after_harvest ?tree))\n    :effect (and (pruned ?tree))\n)\n```\n\n#### Action 7: Cut Back Kumquat Roots\n```lisp\n\nThe actions after the merger are:",

The preconditions ensure the child has prior knowledge of loading the dishwasher, the dishwasher is loaded, and soap is available. The effect updates the child's knowledge and prepares the dishwasher for the wash cycle.\n3. **Step 3:** Two actions are defined for completing the wash cycle: `start-wash-cycle` and `finish-wash-cycle`.

The precondition ensures that the vent has signs of issues (e.g., lint buildup) and is not yet cleaned. The effect identifies the issues and flags the vent for cleaning.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Clean Floor Around Dryer**\n```lisp\n\n(:action inspect_blanket\n   :parameters (?blanket - electric_blanket ?p - player)\n   :precondition (and (at ?p home) (has ?p ?blanket) (not (damaged ?blanket)))\n   :effect (inspected ?blanket)\n)\n\n#### 2.

These were omitted from action generation since they do not involve direct actions.\n2. **Entity States:** The entity states provided (e.g., helmet, visibility, etc.) seem unrelated to the task of washing an electric blanket. These were not used in the PDDL actions, as they do not pertain to the task.\n3. **Player and Location:** The actions assume a player (?p) performing the task at specific locations (e.g., home, laundromat), which is inferred as necessary for the task.\n\nIf the task steps or entity states are refined further, I can adapt the PDDL actions accordingly.\n(:action check_ears_for_foreign_objects\n    :parameters (?child - person ?ear - ear)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_ears ?child)\n                    (foreign_object_unknown ?ear))\n    :effect (and\n              (checked ?ear)\n              (not (foreign_object_unknown ?ear))\n              (foreign_object_status_known ?ear))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThis action represents looking into the child's ears to check for foreign objects. The precondition ensures the child has ears and the foreign object status is unknown. The effect updates the ear's status as checked and makes the foreign object status known.\n\n---\n\n#### Action 2: Avoid_Inserting_Objects_Into_Ear\n```lisp\n\n(:action monitor_for_ear_pain\n    :parameters (?child - person ?ear - ear)\n    :precondition (and\n                    (has_ears ?child)\n                    (not (pain_status_known ?ear)))\n    :effect (and\n              (pain_status_known ?ear)\n              (if (ear_pain ?ear)\n                  (requires_attention ?ear)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThis action involves watching for signs of ear pain in the child. The precondition ensures the child has ears and the pain status is not yet known. The effect updates the pain status to known and, if pain is detected, flags the ear as requiring attention.\n\n---\n\n### Adjustments and Notes:\n1. **Step Adjustments:**  \n   - The original steps were vague or included irrelevant information (e.g., helmet attributes). These were omitted or reinterpreted to focus on ear cleaning and care for a toddler.\n   - The steps were aligned with the task's descriptions to ensure relevance.\n\n2. **Entity State:**  \n   - The provided entity state (helmet attributes) was unrelated to the task. It was ignored to focus on the relevant actions for cleaning a toddler's ears.\n\n3. **Task-Specific Actions:**  \n   - The actions are designed to ensure the safety and hygiene of the toddler's ears while following best practices (e.g., avoiding insertion of objects).\n\nLet me know if further refinements are needed!\nThe actions after the merger are:",

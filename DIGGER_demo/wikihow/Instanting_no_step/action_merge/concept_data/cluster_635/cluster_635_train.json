    "Based on the given example actions and the objective to merge them into a single universal action named \"choose,\" I will create a merged action that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.\n\nHere is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action choose\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?item - object ?location - place)\n    :precondition (and (at ?actor ?location) (available ?item ?location))\n    :effect (and (chosen ?item) (not (available ?item ?location)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Generality**: The merged action uses abstract parameters (?actor - agent, ?item - object, ?location - place) to make it adaptable to various tasks beyond just choosing a steak from the fridge.\n- **State Change**: The precondition ensures the actor is at the specified location and the item is available at that location. The effect marks the item as chosen and updates its availability status.\n- **Simplicity**: The action is simplified to avoid redundancy, focusing on the core logic of choosing and updating the item's state.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different contexts, ensuring the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nWith this merged action, you can adapt it to various scenarios where an agent (actor) needs to choose an item from a location, whether it's a player choosing a steak from the fridge or selecting any other object from a specified place.",
    "To merge the given PDDL actions into a single universal action that adheres to the guidelines, we will create an abstract and adaptable action named `handle` that can be applied to various tasks. Below is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: `handle`\n```pddl\n(:action handle\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity - entity ?location - location ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and (available ?agent)\n                       (at ?agent ?location)\n                       (chosen ?entity)\n                       (clean ?tool))\n    :effect (and (in_tool ?entity ?tool)\n                 (not (chosen ?entity))\n                 (ready_to_process ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generality**: The parameters (`?agent`, `?entity`, `?location`, `?tool`) are abstract and can represent various types of agents (e.g., person, player), entities (e.g., steak, book), locations, and tools (e.g., pan, list). This ensures the action is adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. The `preconditions` ensure that the agent is available and at the correct location, the entity is chosen, and the tool is clean. The `effects` describe the state transformation, where the entity is placed in the tool, it is no longer chosen, and it is marked as ready to process.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by using abstract parameters and combining similar effects. It is simple and efficient, capturing the core logic of the original actions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks. The preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable, ensuring that the action can be logically applied in various contexts.\n\n### Example Instantiations\nHere are some examples of how the merged action `handle` can be instantiated for different specific tasks:\n\n1. **Handling a Chuck Steak**\n    ```pddl\n    (:action handle_chuck_steak\n        :parameters (?p - player ?s - steak ?l - location ?pan - cookware)\n        :precondition (and (available ?p)\n                           (at ?p ?l)\n                           (chosen ?s)\n                           (clean ?pan))\n        :effect (and (in_pan ?s ?pan)\n                     (not (chosen ?s))\n                     (ready_to_cook ?s))\n    )\n    ```\n\n2. **Checking a Bestseller List**\n    ```pddl\n    (:action check_bestseller_list\n        :parameters (?npc - person ?book - book ?list - location ?tool - object)\n        :precondition (and (available ?npc)\n                           (at ?npc ?list)\n                           (chosen ?book)\n                           (clean ?tool)) ; Assuming the tool is some kind of list checker\n        :effect (and (in_tool ?book ?tool)\n                     (not (chosen ?book))\n                     (ready_to_process ?book))\n    )\n    ```\n    \nThese examples demonstrate the adaptability and generality of the merged action `handle`, showing how it can be applied to different tasks while maintaining consistency and simplicity.",

The parameters `?agent` and `?item` are abstract and can represent any person and ingredient, respectively.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions specify that the agent must be available, the item must be at a certain location, and it must be cooked. The item must not have been tested yet. The effects indicate that the item will be cut open, its inside exposed, and it will be marked as tested.\n- **Simplicity:** The action avoids redundancy by combining the core logic of cutting and testing into a single action. Unnecessary complexity is removed.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic. The action ensures that the item is only cut or tested if it meets the necessary conditions, and the state changes are clear and reasonable.\n\nBy following these guidelines, we have created a merged action that is general, simplifies the process, and maintains logical consistency across different tasks.",

The `?method` parameter allows for flexibility in the type of inspection or estimation performed.\n- **State Change**: Each method results in a distinct state change (e.g., `size_checked`, `cut`, `firmness_checked`, `doneness_estimated`), progressively transforming the item's state.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundant checks and effects are avoided by combining similar actions into a single, versatile action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logically grouped by the method type, ensuring consistent behavior across different contexts.\n\nThis universal \"use\" action can now be adapted to various tasks involving inspection or estimation methods, providing a clear and efficient way to handle state changes.",
    "To achieve the objective of merging the given actions into a single universal action that is adaptable, captures the state change, retains core logic, and avoids redundancy, we need to abstract the parameters and unify the state-changing processes. Here is the merged action based on the provided examples:\n\n```lisp\n(:action process_item ; Process an item with specified materials and tools\n    :parameters (?p - player ?item - object ?material1 - material ?material2 - material ?container - container ?tool - tool ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n        (inventory ?p ?item)\n        (inventory ?p ?material1)\n        (inventory ?p ?material2)\n        (inventory ?p ?container)\n        (inventory ?p ?tool)\n        (not (processed ?item))\n        (at ?p ?location))\n    :effect (and\n        (processed ?item)\n        (not (inventory ?p ?material1))\n        (not (inventory ?p ?material2))\n        (not (inventory ?p ?tool))\n        (in ?container ?location)\n        (not (inventory ?p ?container)))\n)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Generality:** The merged action `process_item` uses abstract parameters such as `?item`, `?material1`, `?material2`, `?container`, `?tool`, and `?location` to ensure it can apply to a variety of tasks involving processing items with materials and tools.\n- **State Change:** The preconditions ensure that the player has all necessary items in their inventory and is at the correct location. The effects reflect the state change where the item is processed, materials and tools are used up, and the container is placed at the specified location.\n- **Simplicity:** By unifying similar actions into one, we avoid redundancy. For example, seasoning a steak and covering a bowl both result in a state change where the item is processed, and materials are consumed.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains logical consistency across different contexts by ensuring reasonable preconditions and effects. It checks availability of necessary items and tools, and updates the state accordingly.\n\nThis merged action effectively combines the essence of the provided actions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to various related tasks.",

The `?item` is processed with `?substance` in `?container`, and the `?substance` is removed from the inventory.\n- **Core Logic:** The core logic of preconditions and effects from the initial actions is retained. The item's state is changed from not processed to processed, and the substance is placed in the container with the item.\n- **Avoid Redundancy:** Similar actions are merged effectively, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency:** The preconditions and effects maintain reasonable logic across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can be used in various scenarios where an actor processes an item with a substance in a container, reflecting the changes in the state of the entity involved.",

This increases the action's versatility.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes. The action ensures that the entity is \"prepared\" and the substance is \"available\" before proceeding. The effects show that the entity is now \"coated\" with the substance and its state is \"enhanced.\"\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy**: The action has been simplified by removing unnecessary specificity and combining the effects. The term \"coated\" is generic enough to describe the application of any substance, and \"enhanced\" captures the improvement in the entity's state.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent with the logic of the original actions. The entity must be in a prepared state, and the substance must be available before the action can take place. The result is a transformation of the entity's state, which is logically consistent across different contexts.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various scenarios involving applying a substance to an item, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named `apply`, we need to ensure that the action maintains generality, clearly describes state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency across different contexts. Here is the merged action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action apply ; Apply a substance to an item and update its state\n :parameters (?item - object ?substance - substance)\n :precondition (and (raw ?item) (room_temperature ?item) (available ?substance))\n :effect (and (seasoned ?item) (not (plain ?item))))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action `apply` is designed to be general by using abstract parameters `?item` (which can represent any item, not just a steak) and `?substance` (which can represent any substance to be applied, not just a rub).\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state change. This action checks that the item is raw, at room temperature, and that the substance is available. The effect is that the item becomes seasoned and is no longer plain.\n- **Simplicity**: This action is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity. It directly translates the process of applying a substance to an item and updating the item's state.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that the preconditions are reasonable for various tasks involving applying a substance to an item, and the effects are clear and coherent.\n\nBy combining the actions in this manner, we create a single universal `apply` action that can be adapted to multiple contexts involving the application of different substances to various items.",

    "Here\u2019s the merged **`remove`** action that encapsulates the provided actions, adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: `remove`**\n\n```pddl\n(:action remove ; General action for removing or cleaning an entity or object\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?context - object ?actor - agent)\n  :precondition (and \n    (removable ?entity ?context)               ; Indicates that the entity can be removed from the context\n    (valid_context ?context)                  ; The context must be valid for the removal to occur\n    (has_access ?actor ?context)              ; The actor has access to perform the removal\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (not (in ?entity ?context))               ; Entity is no longer in the context\n    (updated_state ?entity ?actor ?context)   ; Entity, actor, or context may transition to an updated state\n  )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action**\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?context`, and `?actor`) to represent a wide range of scenarios where something is being \"removed.\" For example:\n     - Cleaning a candleholder (`?entity = candleholder, ?context = dirt`).\n     - Removing a jar from the freezer (`?entity = jar, ?context = freezer`).\n     - Straining wax from a saucepan (`?entity = melted wax, ?context = saucepan`).\n     - Removing a wick from a jar (`?entity = wick, ?context = jar`).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The primary effect is that the entity is no longer associated with the context (`(not (in ?entity ?context))`), which aligns with the purpose of all individual actions.\n   - Additionally, an abstract effect `(updated_state ?entity ?actor ?context)` is included to account for any specific state changes (e.g., a dirty strainer, clean candleholder, etc.).\n\n3. **Simplicity and Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy by merging similar preconditions and effects into a single, universal form.\n   - Preconditions like `(removable ?entity ?context)` and `(valid_context ?context)` ensure logical consistency, as they capture the necessary conditions for removal without being overly specific.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of How the Merged Action Applies**\n\n#### 1. **Removing a Jar from the Freezer**\n```pddl\n(:action remove\n  :parameters (?entity - jar ?context - freezer ?actor - user)\n  :precondition (and \n    (removable ?entity ?context) \n    (valid_context ?context) \n    (has_access ?actor ?context))\n  :effect (and \n    (not (in ?entity ?context))\n    (updated_state ?entity ?actor ?context))\n)\n```\n\n#### 2. **Cleaning a Candleholder**\n```pddl\n(:action remove\n  :parameters (?entity - candleholder ?context - dirt ?actor - cleaner)\n  :precondition (and \n    (removable ?entity ?context)\n    (valid_context ?context)\n    (has_access ?actor ?context))\n  :effect (and \n    (not (in ?entity ?context))\n    (updated_state ?entity ?actor ?context))\n)\n```\n\n#### 3. **Removing Hardened Wax Cubes from Mold**\n```pddl\n(:action remove\n  :parameters (?entity - wax_cube ?context - mold ?actor - worker)\n  :precondition (and \n    (removable ?entity ?context)\n    (valid_context ?context)\n    (has_access ?actor ?context))\n  :effect (and \n    (not (in ?entity ?context))\n    (updated_state ?entity ?actor ?context))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Benefits of the Merged Action**\n\n- **Generality**: The action can handle a wide variety of tasks involving the removal or cleaning of objects.\n- **Simplicity**: By abstracting common components, the merged action avoids unnecessary repetition.\n- **Efficiency**: Redundant preconditions and effects are avoided, ensuring concise and efficient planning.\n- **Flexibility**: The abstract parameters allow the action to adapt dynamically to different contexts and tasks.\n\n",
    "(:action cut ; Generalized action for cutting an object to change its state\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - object ?tool - tool ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (holds_tool ?agent ?tool) ; Agent must have the tool\n        (pre_cut_state ?item ?target) ; Item must be in a state where it can be cut relative to the target\n        (not (cut ?item ?target)) ; Item must not already be in the \"cut\" state\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (cut ?item ?target) ; Marks the item as cut\n        (transformed_state ?item ?target) ; Updates the item's state to reflect the cutting operation\n        (not (pre_cut_state ?item ?target)) ; Removes the pre-cut state\n        (tool_used ?tool) ; Marks the tool as used\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The action `cut` is designed to adapt to a variety of cutting tasks by using abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?item`, `?tool`, `?target`). \n   - This includes scenarios like cutting a lace strip to fit a candleholder, cutting a wick to size, or cutting an orange on a cutting board.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the action only applies to items that are in a \"pre-cut state\" (`pre_cut_state ?item ?target`).\n   - The effects describe the state transformation: marking the item as cut (`cut ?item ?target`), updating its state (`transformed_state ?item ?target`), and marking the tool as used (`tool_used ?tool`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant parameters and effects are removed. For example, individual check conditions like `fits_around ?l ?c` or `on_surface ?cb ?o` are generalized into `pre_cut_state ?item ?target`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the correct agent, tool, and state conditions are met before the action can be executed.\n   - Effects are logically consistent, clearly reflecting the outcome of the action.\n\n### Examples of How the Merged Action Applies:\n- **Cutting a Lace Strip**:\n  - `?agent = worker, ?item = lace, ?tool = scissors, ?target = candleholder`\n  - Preconditions: `(holds_tool worker scissors)` and `(pre_cut_state lace candleholder)`\n  - Effects: `(cut lace candleholder)` and `(transformed_state lace candleholder)`\n\n- **Cutting a Wick**:\n  - `?agent = person, ?item = wick, ?tool = knife, ?target = mold`\n  - Preconditions: `(holds_tool person knife)` and `(pre_cut_state wick mold)`\n  - Effects: `(cut wick mold)` and `(transformed_state wick mold)`\n\n- **Cutting an Orange**:\n  - `?agent = chef, ?item = orange, ?tool = knife, ?target = cutting_board`\n  - Preconditions: `(holds_tool chef knife)` and `(pre_cut_state orange cutting_board)`\n  - Effects: `(cut orange cutting_board)` and `(transformed_state orange cutting_board)`\n\nThis merged `cut` action is now flexible enough to handle various cutting tasks in a generic and reusable way.",
    "The combined and universal action `pour` is created to encapsulate and abstract the essence of actions involving the pouring or applying of a material (liquid, wax, etc.) into a container, mold, or surface. It generalizes the process while avoiding redundancy, ensuring logical consistency, and maintaining clear state transitions. Below is the merged action:\n\n---\n\n### **Action Name: `pour`**\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?source - container ?target - container ?material - substance ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and \n        (contains ?source ?material)           ; Source must contain the material to be poured\n        (empty ?target)                       ; Target must be empty or ready to receive the material\n        (usable ?tool)                        ; Tool (if applicable) must be usable for the task\n        (prepared ?material)                  ; Material must be in the correct state (e.g., melted, liquid)\n        (available ?actor)                    ; Actor performing the action must be available\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (not (contains ?source ?material))    ; Source no longer contains the material\n        (contains ?target ?material)          ; Target now contains the material\n        (used ?tool)                          ; Tool has been used (if applicable)\n        (state-transition ?material poured)   ; Material state changes to \"poured\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the `pour` Action**\n1. **Generality**:\n   - Abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?source`, `?target`, `?material`, `?tool`) allow this action to be applied across a variety of tasks, such as pouring wax into molds, coating pans, or applying materials to surfaces.\n   - The action does not assume specific entities (e.g., candle molds, tart pans) but uses broad categories that can be adapted to specific instances.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action transitions the state of the material from being in the source container to being in the target container.\n   - It ensures that the material is in the correct state (e.g., melted) before pouring and updates the environment to reflect the changes after the pour.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the actor is available, the source contains the material, the target is empty, the tool is usable, and the material is prepared for pouring.\n   - Effects specify that the material is transferred from the source to the target, the tool is marked as used, and the material's state is updated.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Actions like \"pour wax into molds,\" \"spray tart pans,\" \"pour liquid wax into a container,\" etc., are generalized into a single action by abstracting away the specifics of the material (e.g., wax, spray) and the target (e.g., molds, pans).\n   - This eliminates the need for multiple similar actions.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable across different contexts, ensuring robustness and adaptability.\n   - For example, if the material is not prepared (e.g., not melted), the action cannot proceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of `pour` Action in Use**\n\n#### 1. Pour Melted Wax into a Candle Mold\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n    :parameters (?actor - player ?source - saucepan ?target - candle_mold ?material - wax ?tool - ladle)\n    :precondition (and \n        (contains ?source ?material)\n        (empty ?target)\n        (prepared ?material)\n        (usable ?tool)\n        (available ?actor)\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (not (contains ?source ?material))\n        (contains ?target ?material)\n        (used ?tool)\n        (state-transition ?material poured)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### 2.

Pour Boiling Water into a Wax Pot\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n    :parameters (?actor - player ?source - kettle ?target - wax_pot ?material - boiling_water ?tool - none)\n    :precondition (and \n        (contains ?source ?material)\n        (empty ?target)\n        (prepared ?material)\n        (available ?actor)\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (not (contains ?source ?material))\n        (contains ?target ?material)\n        (state-transition ?material poured)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n#### 4. Pour Wax into Shot Glasses\n```pddl\n(:action pour\n    :parameters (?actor - crafter ?source - container ?target - shot_glass ?material - wax ?tool - funnel)\n    :precondition (and \n        (contains ?source ?material)\n        (empty ?target)\n        (prepared ?material)\n        (usable ?tool)\n        (available ?actor)\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (not (contains ?source ?material))\n        (contains ?target ?material)\n        (used ?tool)\n        (state-transition ?material poured)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Advantages of the Merged `pour` Action**\n- **Flexibility**: It can be used in a wide range of tasks, from crafting candles to cooking.\n- **Simplicity**: Reduces the need to define multiple similar actions, streamlining the PDDL domain.\n- **Clarity**: Clearly defines the conditions under which the action can occur and its effects on the state of the environment.\n- **Extendability**: New tasks can easily use the `pour` action by defining specific parameters and adapting the preconditions and effects.\n\nThis universal `pour` action is a robust and adaptable abstraction that satisfies the requirements of generality, state transformation, simplicity, and logical consistency.",

Abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?item`, and `?location` allow it to adapt to different scenarios.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions clearly define the starting state (e.g., item not gathered, disorganized, or in storage), and the effects describe the resulting state (e.g., item gathered, organized, or moved).\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of each original action is preserved, with preconditions and effects merged into a single, cohesive action. For example:\n   - If the item needs to be taped, the precondition checks if it\u2019s wrapped but not taped, and the effect marks it as taped.\n   - If the item needs to be purchased, the precondition ensures it\u2019s on sale and the actor has money, and the effect adds it to the inventory and deducts money.\n   - If the item is disorganized, the precondition reflects this, and the effect organizes it.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Similar effects (e.g., marking an item as gathered or ready) are combined to simplify the action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring that each outcome is tied to its respective precondition. For example, an item cannot be marked as taped unless it was previously wrapped but untaped.\n\nThis single action, `gather`, can now handle a wide variety of tasks related to collecting, preparing, and organizing resources, making it versatile and efficient for a wide range of planning domains.",
    "To merge the provided `move_to_well_ventilated_area`-like actions into a generalized and universal `move` action, here is the final output:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `move`\n\n```pddl\n(:action move ; Move an entity to a specific location or situation\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?destination - location)\n  :precondition (and \n        (not (is_in ?entity ?destination)) ; The entity should not already be in the destination\n        (valid_destination ?destination) ; Destination must meet a valid condition (abstracted)\n  )\n  :effect (and \n        (is_in ?entity ?destination) ; The entity is now in the destination\n  )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action `move` is generalized to work for any `entity` (abstract object) and `destination` (abstract location). This avoids being tied to specific cases like candleholders or specific areas.\n   - The precondition `(valid_destination ?destination)` is an abstract placeholder for any specific conditions that the destination must meet, such as being ventilated, safe, or otherwise suitable for the operation.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The state change is simple: an entity that is not in a destination is moved to that destination, updating the respective state to reflect this.\n   - The precondition ensures that the move only happens if the entity is not already in the destination.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Unnecessary specificity, such as references to candleholders or ventilation, is removed. These details can be encoded using domain-specific predicates (e.g., `valid_destination` could encapsulate conditions such as `is_ventilated`).\n   - The action is efficient and avoids redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects ensure that the action only applies when the move operation makes sense (i.e., the entity is not already in the destination, and the destination is valid in the given context).\n\n### How This Merged Action Works:\n- This generalized `move` action can now be used across a variety of tasks, whether it's moving a candleholder to a ventilated area, moving a person to a specific room, or relocating an object to a designated storage area.\n- The abstract predicates (e.g., `valid_destination`) allow for customization in specific domains while keeping the action reusable across different problems.\n\n",
    "Here\u2019s how the merged action for the *allow* task would look after combining the provided action sets, while maintaining the specified guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n### Merged Action: `allow`\n\n```lisp\n(:action allow ; Allow a process to complete and update the object's state\n    :parameters (?obj - object ?process - process_type)\n    :precondition \n        (and \n            (in_progress ?process ?obj)\n            (not (completed ?process ?obj))\n        )\n    :effect \n        (and \n            (completed ?process ?obj)\n            (not (in_progress ?process ?obj))\n        )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is generalized to apply to any object (`?obj`) undergoing any process (`?process`), making it adaptable to a variety of tasks like allowing paint to dry or wax to harden.\n   - Instead of using specific attributes like `is_painted` or `wax_in_jar`, it uses abstract conditions like `in_progress` and `completed`.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition ensures the process is currently in progress (`in_progress`) and not yet completed (`not (completed)`).\n   - The effect updates the state to mark the process as completed (`completed`) and removes the `in_progress` status.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action removes redundant conditions and unifies similar logic into a single abstract action, reducing unnecessary complexity.\n   - It uses abstract parameters (`?obj` and `?process`) to replace task-specific attributes.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks by ensuring that the preconditions and effects are reasonable for any generic process.\n   - The naming and logical flow are intuitive and align with the objective of transitioning an object's state from \"in progress\" to \"completed.\"\n\n### How the Merged Action Captures the Original Actions:\n- **`allow_paint_to_dry`:**\n  - `?c` (candleholder) is generalized to `?obj` (object).\n  - The drying process is abstracted as `?process`.\n  - The preconditions `(is_painted ?c true)` and `(is_dry ?c false)` are replaced with abstract conditions `in_progress` and `not (completed)`.\n  - The effect `(is_dry ?c true)` is replaced with the abstract effect `completed`.\n\n- **`allow_wax_to_harden`:**\n  - `?j` (jar) is generalized to `?obj` (object).\n  - The hardening process is abstracted as `?process`.\n  - The preconditions `(wax_in_jar ?j)` and `(not (hardened ?j))` are replaced with `in_progress` and `not (completed)`.\n  - The effects `(hardened ?j)` and `(not (wax_in_jar ?j))` are replaced with `completed` and `not (in_progress)`.\n\n### Key Benefits of the Merged Action:\n- **Adaptability:** The action can now handle any process involving state transformation, not just painting or hardening.\n- **Efficiency:** Redundant logic is eliminated, and the action is more concise and reusable.\n- **Clarity:** The use of abstract parameters and conditions makes it easier to understand and apply to a wide variety of tasks.",
    "Here is the merged action for the \"use\" task that combines all relevant actions into a single universal action while maintaining generality, capturing state changes, avoiding redundancy, and staying logically consistent:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `use`\n```pddl\n(:action use\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?task - task)\n    :precondition (and\n        (is_ready ?entity false) ; The entity must not yet be marked as ready\n        (task_sequence_completed ?entity ?task) ; The required task sequence must be fully completed\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (is_ready ?entity true) ; Marks the entity as ready for use\n        (used_for ?entity ?task) ; Associates the entity with the completed task\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The `use` action is abstract and applies to any entity (`?entity`) and task (`?task`), making it adaptable to multiple scenarios.\n   - This generality ensures that it can be used for tasks beyond just candleholder preparation, such as preparing other objects or completing multi-step processes.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the entity is not yet ready (`is_ready ?entity false`) and that all preparatory tasks in the sequence have been completed (`task_sequence_completed ?entity ?task`).\n   - The effect updates the entity's state to ready (`is_ready ?entity true`) and records the association between the entity and the completed task (`used_for ?entity ?task`).\n\n3. **Core Logic**:\n   - The action's structure ensures that it combines multiple preparatory steps (like cleaning, painting, and drying) into a single meaningful transition: marking the entity as \"used\" or \"ready\" after all necessary steps are fulfilled.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:\n   - Instead of listing all individual preparatory steps (e.g., cleaning, painting, drying), the merged action abstracts them under a single condition: `task_sequence_completed ?entity ?task`.\n   - This avoids duplicating logic for each step while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects align with the logical flow of preparing an entity for use, ensuring that no step is skipped or repeated unnecessarily.\n   - The action is consistent across different contexts and can be reused for other workflows, provided the preparatory tasks are appropriately defined.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Maps to the Original Actions:\n\nThe original actions (cleaning, cutting, wrapping, painting, drying, etc.) represent a sequential process to prepare an entity. By abstracting these steps into a single condition (`task_sequence_completed ?entity ?task`), the merged action focuses on the final state transition: marking the entity as ready for use.\n\nFor example:\n- `clean_candleholder`, `spray_paint_candleholder`, and `allow_paint_to_dry` are part of the preparatory sequence for the `use` task.\n- These steps would be tracked and verified as part of the `task_sequence_completed` predicate before the `use` action can be executed.\n\n---\n\n### Flexibility of the Merged Action:\n\nTo adapt this action to other workflows, you simply define the `task_sequence_completed` predicate for each specific task. For example:\n- For preparing a candleholder: `task_sequence_completed` would include cleaning, wrapping, painting, and drying.\n- For another task (e.g., assembling a piece of furniture): `task_sequence_completed` might include gathering tools, assembling parts, and tightening screws.\n\nThis modular approach ensures that the `use` action remains universal and applicable to diverse scenarios.\n\n",
    "Here is the merged action for your \"pop\" task based on the provided examples and guidelines:\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: pop**\n```lisp\n(:action pop ; Perform a task to extract or remove an entity from a container or surface\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?container - object ?tool - tool ?substance - material)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (contained ?substance ?container) ; The substance must be present in the container\n                  (usable_tool ?actor ?tool)        ; The actor must have and be capable of using the tool\n                  (suitable_tool ?tool ?substance) ; The tool must be suitable for the substance\n                  (ready_state ?container))        ; The container must be in a ready state for the action\n  :effect (and \n           (not (contained ?substance ?container)) ; The substance is no longer in the container\n           (removed ?substance ?container)         ; The substance has been explicitly removed\n           (extracted ?substance ?container))      ; The substance is now a separate entity\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action:**\n\n1. **Generality**: This action is abstract and adaptable to a variety of tasks involving extraction, removal, or separation. For example, it could apply to removing wax from a jar, extracting items from a container, or detaching entities from surfaces.\n\n2. **State Change**: \n   - Preconditions ensure the container is ready, the tool is appropriate, and the actor is prepared for the task.\n   - Effects clearly indicate the transformation: the substance is no longer in the container, it is removed, and it is explicitly extracted.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects (e.g., removing and extracting) into a single, logically consistent representation.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects ensure the action is always logically valid.

The parameters (`?actor` and `?target`) are kept abstract to allow flexibility in scenarios.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The action clearly represents a state change:\n   - Preconditions: The target object must be clean, not already wet, and the actor must have the capability to interact with the target.\n   - Effects: The target becomes wet and ceases to be clean.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by unifying the logic of licking actions into a single action. Unnecessary complexity is removed, and the logic is streamlined for clarity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent across different contexts. For instance, the requirements for the `lick` action (cleanliness of the target, interaction capability, etc.) are logical and adaptable.\n\nThis unified action can now be used in diverse environments where licking transforms the state of an object, such as cleaning, wetting, or interacting with objects in a game or simulation.",

It uses parameters `?u` (user), `?t` (task), and `?o` (object) to generalize across different tasks and objects.\n   - Covers various scenarios where a user practices a skill or task using a specific object (e.g., extinguishing a candle, writing, painting).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - **Preconditions**:\n     - `(has_skill ?u ?t)`: The user must have the basic skill required to practice the task.\n     - `(can_practice ?u ?t ?o)`: The user must be able to practice the task on the specified object.\n     - `(not (mastered ?u ?t))`: The skill shouldn't already be mastered; this ensures that the action is only relevant for skill improvement.\n   - **Effects**:\n     - `(improved_skill ?u ?t)`: The user's skill in the task improves as a result of practice.\n     - `(not (unskilled ?u ?t))`: If the user was previously unskilled, they are no longer considered unskilled after practice.\n     - `(not (incomplete ?t ?o))`: Marks the task as complete for the given object, indicating progress.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects across actions like `practice_extinguishing` and incorporating the logic of prerequisite actions (e.g., ensuring the object is ready for practice).\n   - It removes unnecessary complexity by abstracting specific steps (e.g., lighting candles, positioning hands) into a single precondition `(can_practice ?u ?t ?o)`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action ensures that all preconditions and effects are consistent with the logic of practicing and improving a skill. Preconditions like `(has_skill ?u ?t)` and `(not (mastered ?u ?t))` ensure logical applicability.\n   - Effects like `(improved_skill ?u ?t)` and `(not (unskilled ?u ?t))` reflect the gradual transformation of the user's state toward skill mastery.\n\n---\n\n### How It Covers the Original Actions:\n1. **`practice_extinguishing`**:\n   - Abstracted the specific action of extinguishing into a general `practice` action with parameters `?t` (extinguishing) and `?o` (candle).\n   - Retained the state changes (e.g., skill improvement) and added general preconditions and effects to ensure adaptability.\n\n2. **`light_candle`, `lick_fingers`, `position_hand_near_flame`, `extinguish_candle_with_fingers`**:\n   - The individual steps of preparing the object (e.g., lighting the candle, wetting fingers) are generalized into the precondition `(can_practice ?u ?t ?o)`.\n   - The merged action focuses on the higher-level logic of practicing a skill, abstracting away the specific mechanics of preparation.\n\n---\n\nThis universal **practice** action is now broadly applicable to a variety of tasks and objects, satisfying the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.

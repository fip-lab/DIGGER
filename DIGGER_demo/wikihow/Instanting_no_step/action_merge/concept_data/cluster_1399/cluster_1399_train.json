    "Below is the merged action for the \"run\" tasks, designed to generalize and combine the two provided actions involving melting ice under hot water or using a hairdryer:\n\n```lisp\n(:action run ; Perform a transformation on an object using a resource\n    :parameters (?object - object ?location - location ?resource - resource)\n    :precondition (and\n        (at ?object ?location)\n        (active ?resource)\n        (not (transformed ?object))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (transformed ?object)\n        (affected_by ?object ?resource)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the \"run\" Merged Action:\n\n#### Generality:\n- The merged action uses abstract parameters: `?object`, `?location`, and `?resource`. This ensures adaptability for a variety of tasks beyond just melting ice.\n- The action is generic enough to apply to any transformation task where a resource affects an object.\n\n#### State Change:\n- Preconditions:\n  - `(at ?object ?location)`: Ensures the object is at the required location.\n  - `(active ?resource)`: Checks that the resource (e.g., hot water or a hairdryer) is available and active.\n  - `(not (transformed ?object))`: Ensures the object has not already been transformed.\n- Effects:\n  - `(transformed ?object)`: Represents the state change where the object has been transformed (e.g., ice melted).\n  - `(affected_by ?object ?resource)`: Tracks which resource caused the transformation.\n\n#### Simplicity:\n- Redundant details like specifying \"hot water\" or \"hairdryer\" are abstracted into the general concept of a \"resource.\"\n- The effects `(melted ?ice)` and `(wet ?ice)` are combined into a single effect `(transformed ?object)` to simplify and generalize the state change.\n\n#### Logical Consistency:\n- The preconditions and effects are consistent across various tasks involving transformations.\n- The action maintains adaptability while capturing the core logic of the original actions.\n\n---\n\n### How This Merged Action Works for the Given Tasks:\n1. **Run Ice Under Hot Water**:\n   - `?object` \u2192 `ice`\n   - `?location` \u2192 `sink`\n   - `?resource` \u2192 `hot water`\n   - Satisfies the preconditions (ice is at the sink, hot water is active, and the ice is not melted).\n   - Effects: The ice is transformed (melted) and affected by the hot water.\n\n2. **Use Hair Dryer to Melt Ice**:\n   - `?object` \u2192 `ice`\n   - `?location` \u2192 location of the ice\n   - `?resource` \u2192 `hairdryer`\n   - Satisfies the preconditions (ice is at the location, hairdryer is active, and the ice is not melted).\n   - Effects: The ice is transformed (melted) and affected by the hairdryer.\n\nThis universal \"run\" action can now handle a variety of tasks involving object transformations using different resources.",
    "Here\u2019s how the \"use\" action would look after merging the given example actions into a single *universal action* called `use`. This action will be generalized to handle a variety of tasks involving using tools or resources to modify the state of an object.\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: `use`**\n\n```lisp\n(:action use ; Use a tool or resource to modify an object's state\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?tool - tool ?target - object ?location - location)\n    :precondition (and\n        (at ?target ?location) ; The target must be at the location\n        (functional ?tool)     ; The tool must be functional\n        (not (desired_state ?target)) ; The target must not already be in the desired state\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (desired_state ?target) ; The target is now in the desired state\n        (modified ?target)      ; The target has been modified\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action:**\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The merged action `use` abstracts the specific tasks (e.g., melting ice with a hair dryer, pouring salt on ice) into a more general form.\n   - Parameters like `?tool`, `?target`, and `?location` make it applicable to a variety of tasks involving the use of tools or resources.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action's preconditions ensure the tool is functional and the target is not already in the desired state.\n   - The effects clearly show that the target's state is changed to the \"desired state\" and is marked as \"modified.\"\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The logic is simple and avoids redundancy by abstracting the actions into a single, adaptable framework.\n   - Specific details (e.g., what the \"desired state\" is) can be encoded in separate domain-specific predicates if needed.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are contextually reasonable and ensure the action is grounded in logical rules.\n\n---\n\n### **How This Applies to the Examples:**\n\n1. **Use Hair Dryer to Melt Ice**:\n   - `?tool = hair_dryer`\n   - `?target = ice`\n   - `?location = freezer`\n   - The hair dryer is used to change the state of the ice to \"melted.\"\n\n2. **Pour Salt on Ice**:\n   - `?tool = salt`\n   - `?target = ice`\n   - `?location = freezer`\n   - Salt is used as a resource to change the state of the ice to \"melted\" (or any other desired state).\n\nBy abstracting these into a single action, we simplify the domain's representation while maintaining expressive power.",
    "### Merged Action: `perform_task`\n\n```pddl\n(:action perform_task\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?resource - object ?location - location ?target - object ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?agent ?location)\n        (available ?resource)\n        (ready ?tool)\n        (not (processed ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (processed ?target)\n        (updated ?resource)\n        (not (ready ?tool))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n\n#### **Generality**\nThis universal `perform_task` action introduces abstract parameters:\n- `?agent` represents any entity (e.g., a person, machine, or player).\n- `?resource` represents any object or resource used in the task (e.g., salt, glue sticks, butter, or water).\n- `?location` represents where the action occurs.\n- `?target` represents the object being processed or acted upon.\n- `?tool` represents an optional tool or instrument used to perform the task.\n\nBy abstracting the parameters, the action is adaptable to a wide range of use cases, such as melting ice, preparing butter, or filling a container.\n\n---\n\n#### **State Change**\n- Preconditions ensure the action is logically consistent and ready to execute. For example:\n  - The `?agent` is at the required `?location`.\n  - The `?resource` is available (e.g., salt, glue stick, cream, etc.).\n  - The `?tool` is ready (e.g., a glue gun, blender, or measuring cup).\n  - The `?target` has not yet been processed.\n\n- Effects clearly describe the state change:\n  - The `?target` becomes processed (e.g., ice melted, butter placed, or glue stick fed).\n  - The `?resource` is updated (e.g., consumed, moved, or altered).\n  - The `?tool` transitions to a \"not ready\" state after use (e.g., used or no longer heating).\n\n---\n\n#### **Core Logic**\nThe merged action retains the core logic of the original actions:\n1. **Preconditions**: Ensure the agent, resources, and tools are in the correct state to perform the task.\n2. **Effects**: Reflect the desired state changes, such as transforming the target, consuming resources, or utilizing tools.\n\n---\n\n#### **Avoid Redundancy**\nBy unifying similar actions (e.g., pouring, scooping, blending, or heating), the merged action avoids redundancy while maintaining flexibility. The abstract parameters and generalized effects cover a broad range of scenarios without duplicating logic.\n\n---\n\n#### **Logical Consistency**\n- Preconditions and effects are consistent with the original tasks, ensuring the action applies to diverse contexts without breaking logical flow.\n- The `perform_task` action can be instantiated with specific parameters to model any of the original actions, including:\n  - Pouring salt on ice.\n  - Blending ingredients.\n  - Placing butter in a container.\n  - Melting glue sticks.\n\n---\n\n### Example Instantiations of `perform_task`\n\n1. **Melting Ice Using Salt**\n```pddl\n(:action perform_task\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?resource - salt ?location - surface ?target - ice ?tool - none)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?agent ?location)\n        (available ?resource)\n        (not (processed ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (processed ?target) ; Ice is melted\n        (updated ?resource) ; Salt is used\n    )\n)\n```\n\n2. **Filling a Measuring Cup**\n```pddl\n(:action perform_task\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?resource - water_source ?location - sink ?target - measuring_cup ?tool - none)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?agent ?location)\n        (available ?resource)\n        (not (processed ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (processed ?target) ; Measuring cup is filled\n        (updated ?resource) ; Water source is used\n    )\n)\n```\n\n3. **Plugging in a Glue Gun**\n```pddl\n(:action perform_task\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?resource - electricity ?location - flat_surface ?target - glue_gun ?tool - none)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?agent ?location)\n        (available ?resource)\n        (not (processed ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (processed ?target) ; Glue gun is plugged in and heating\n        (updated ?resource) ; Electricity is consumed\n    )\n)\n```\n\n4. **Placing Butter into a Glass**\n```pddl\n(:action perform_task\n    :parameters (?agent - player ?resource - butter ?location - kitchen ?target - glass ?tool - none)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?agent ?location)\n        (available ?resource)\n        (not (processed ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (processed ?target) ; Butter is placed into the glass\n        (updated ?resource) ; Butter is moved\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe unified `perform_task` action simplifies the PDDL model by abstracting common patterns across different tasks. It ensures generality, logical consistency, and adaptability to a variety of contexts. By customizing the parameters and preconditions/effects, the merged action can model diverse scenarios while avoiding redundancy and unnecessary complexity.",
    "Here is the merged action for the tasks involving \"cutting\":\n\n```pddl\n(:action cut ;  Generalized action for cutting or slicing an item\n    :parameters (?p - person ?item - ingredient ?tool - tool ?surface - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?surface)                ; Person must be at the designated surface or location\n        (has_tool ?p ?tool)             ; Person must have the tool in possession\n        (is_tool ?tool)                 ; The tool must be a valid cutting tool (e.g., knife)\n        (is_cuttable ?item)             ; The item must be something that can be cut\n        (not (is_cut ?item))            ; The item must not already be in a cut state\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (not (is_whole ?item))          ; The item is no longer whole\n        (is_cut ?item)                  ; The item is now in a cut state\n        (size ?item 0.5)                ; Optionally, specify size after cutting\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n1. **Generality**:\n   - Abstract parameters like `?item` and `?tool` allow this action to apply to any ingredient or tool, rather than being tied to specific ones like butter or a knife.\n   - The use of `?surface` makes it flexible for cutting on any valid location (e.g., cutting board or countertop).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the person has the required tool, the item is cuttable, and the item is not already cut.\n   - Effects transform the state of the item to a \"cut\" state and optionally adjust its size.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancies like separate conditions for butter-specific or knife-specific logic are removed.\n   - The merged action focuses on the general process of cutting, irrespective of specific ingredients or tools.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent with the logic of cutting\u2014ensuring the action cannot be performed if the item is already cut or if the required conditions (e.g., having a tool) are not met.\n\n### Usage of the Merged Action\nThis merged action can now be used in any scenario where cutting or slicing is required, whether it involves butter, vegetables, or other cuttable items, as long as the preconditions are met.",

For example, the action assumes that a resource cannot be measured unless it is present at the counter and the destination container is empty.\n\nWith this structure, the \"measure\" action can be reused in various tasks that involve measuring and transferring resources.",
    "To merge actions related to \"push\" into a universal action, we need to ensure that the action is abstract and adaptable, while maintaining logical consistency and avoiding redundancy. Here's the merged action:\n\n---\n\n### Action Name After Merge: `push`\n\n#### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action push ; Push an entity to change its physical state or distribution\n  :parameters (?actor - agent ?entity - object ?target - location)\n  :precondition (and (at ?actor ?target) (requires_adjustment ?entity ?target))\n  :effect (and (not (requires_adjustment ?entity ?target)) (adjusted ?entity ?target))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is generalized to handle any task where an entity is being \"pushed\" or adjusted to change its state. For example:\n     - Pushing butter in a measuring cup to settle it.\n     - Pushing an object into alignment or a desired configuration.\n   - Abstract parameters (`?actor`, `?entity`, `?target`) make it adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The `precondition` checks if the action is necessary (e.g., the entity requires adjustment).\n   - The `effect` updates the state of the entity to indicate that the adjustment has been completed.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant or task-specific details (e.g., butter-specific terms) have been removed in favor of abstract terms like `entity`, `target`, and `adjusted`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts where \"pushing\" is applicable.\n   - The action ensures that the process is only performed when necessary (`requires_adjustment`) and updates the state to reflect the completion (`adjusted`).\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases of the Merged `push` Action:\n\n1. **Pushing Butter Down in a Measuring Cup**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action push\n     :parameters (?p - person ?butter - butter ?measuring_cup - measuring_cup)\n     :precondition (and (at ?p ?measuring_cup) (butter_piling_up ?measuring_cup ?butter))\n     :effect (and (not (butter_piling_up ?measuring_cup ?butter)) (butter_settled ?measuring_cup ?butter))\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Pushing an Object to Align It**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action push\n     :parameters (?worker - person ?box - box ?shelf - shelf)\n     :precondition (and (at ?worker ?shelf) (misaligned ?box ?shelf))\n     :effect (and (not (misaligned ?box ?shelf)) (aligned ?box ?shelf))\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Stopping Butter Addition When Water Reaches Desired Level**:\n   ```lisp\n   (:action push\n     :parameters (?chef - person ?butter - butter ?bowl - bowl)\n     :precondition (and (at ?chef ?bowl) (water_level_incorrect ?bowl))\n     :effect (and (not (water_level_incorrect ?bowl)) (water_level_correct ?bowl))\n   )\n   ```\n\n---\n\nBy merging the actions into a single universal `push` action, we achieve a reusable, adaptable, and logically consistent PDDL action that can be applied across a variety of tasks involving physical adjustments or transformations.",
    "To merge the provided actions related to the \"stop\" task, let's analyze the core logic, generalize the parameters, avoid redundancy, and ensure logical consistency.

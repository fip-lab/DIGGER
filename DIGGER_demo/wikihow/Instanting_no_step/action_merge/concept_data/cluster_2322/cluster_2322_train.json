Parameters are abstract (`?entity` for the object being groomed and `?tool1`, `?tool2` for tools used).\n2. **Preconditions**: Ensures the entity requires grooming (`requires_grooming ?entity`) and that the tools are available.\n3. **Effects**: The entity is groomed (`styled ?entity`), and the tools are consumed.\n4. **Simplicity**: Redundant steps are removed. The action captures the core logic of grooming tasks in one concise definition.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Applies to any object and tools, ensuring versatility across contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Universal Action: Hang\n```lisp\n(:action hang ; Hang an item onto a support structure\n    :parameters (?item - object ?structure - object)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (not (hanging ?item)) \n                    (support_structure ?structure))\n    :effect (and \n             (hanging ?item) \n             (used ?structure)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Merged Action: Hang\n1. **Generality**: Combines actions related to hanging garments, loops, or other items onto a structure. Parameters are abstract (`?item` for the object being hung and `?structure` for the support structure).\n2. **Preconditions**: Ensures the item is not already hanging and there is a valid support structure.\n3. **Effects**: The item becomes hanging, and the structure is marked as used.\n4. **Simplicity**: Captures the essence of hanging operations in one action.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Works for any item and structure, ensuring broad applicability.\n\n---\n\n### Universal Action: Style_Braids\n```lisp\n(:action style_braids ; Adjust or style braids to achieve a desired appearance\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?style - object ?tool - object)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (braided ?entity) \n                    (available ?tool))\n    :effect (and \n             (styled ?entity ?style) \n             (not (available ?tool))))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Merged Action: Style_Braids\n1. **Generality**: Covers actions like wrapping braids, creating box braids, taming baby hairs, and switching braid styles. Parameters are abstract (`?entity` for the braid, `?style` for the desired style, and `?tool` for the styling tool).\n2. **Preconditions**: Ensures the entity is braided and the required tool is available.\n3. **Effects**: The braid is styled into the desired form, and the tool is consumed.\n4. **Simplicity**: Unifies various braid-related actions into one universal operation.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Maintains flexibility for different braid styles and tools.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features of Merged Actions\n1. **Generality**: Abstract parameters ensure adaptability to various tasks and contexts.\n2. **State Change**: Each action clearly transforms the entity's state (e.g., from `requires_grooming` to `styled`).\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundant details are removed, focusing on core logic.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are reasonable and adaptable across scenarios.\n\nBy merging actions into these universal forms, the PDDL models become more compact, efficient, and versatile for diverse tasks.",
    "Here is the merged action for the \"tame\" task, following the provided guidelines:\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action tame ; Tame or manage an entity and update its state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?tool - resource)\n  :precondition (and (needs_taming ?entity) (available ?tool))\n  :effect (and (tamed ?entity) (not (needs_taming ?entity)) (not (available ?tool)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action abstracts the task of taming into a general operation applicable to any entity that requires taming, not just limited to baby hairs. The `?entity` parameter represents the entity to be tamed, and `?tool` represents the resource/tool used for taming.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(needs_taming ?entity)` ensures that the action only applies to entities requiring taming, while `(available ?tool)` ensures the required tool is available. The effect `(tamed ?entity)` marks the entity as tamed, and the original state `(needs_taming ?entity)` is removed. Similarly, the tool is marked as no longer available.\n3. **Simplicity**: Unnecessary complexity is avoided by using abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?tool`) and removing specific references to hairlines or edge control cream.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic of preconditions and effects remains consistent across different contexts where taming is required, ensuring applicability to a variety of tasks.\n\nThis merged action can now be used as a universal \"tame\" operation for managing entities across different scenarios, whether it's taming baby hairs, calming an animal, or managing a metaphorical state requiring control.",
    "Here is the merged **`create`** action that combines all the provided actions into one generalized and universal action. This action captures the essence of creating various hairstyles and adapting to different tasks while maintaining simplicity, logical consistency, and clear state transitions:\n\n```lisp\n(:action create\n  :parameters (?p - person ?h - hair ?style - hairstyle ?components - set)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (available ?p)\n                  (inventory ?p ?h)\n                  (natural_hair ?h) ; Hair is in a natural state or usable for styling\n                  (knows_style ?p ?style) ; The person knows the technique for the style\n                  (valid_components ?h ?style ?components) ; Components are valid for the desired style\n                )\n  :effect (and\n           (styled ?h ?style) ; Hair is styled into the desired hairstyle\n           (knows_advanced_style ?p ?style) ; The person improves skill in the style\n           (updated_components ?h ?components) ; Components are updated to reflect the new style\n           (not (natural_hair ?h)) ; Hair is no longer in the natural state\n          )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n#### **Generality**\n- The action uses abstract parameters (`?p` for person, `?h` for hair, `?style` for hairstyle, and `?components` for the collection of braid elements or components) to make it applicable to a wide variety of tasks.\n- This approach allows it to handle tasks like creating braided headbands, box braids, cornrows, braided crowns, upside-down braids, fishtail braids, etc.\n\n#### **State Change**\n- **Preconditions:** \n  - `available ?p`: The person must be available for the task.\n  - `inventory ?p ?h`: The person must have access to the hair to style.\n  - `natural_hair ?h`: The hair must be in a natural state or suitable for styling.\n  - `knows_style ?p ?style`: The person must know the basic technique for the desired hairstyle.\n  - `valid_components ?h ?style ?components`: The components (e.g., braids or hair sections) must be valid for forming the desired style.\n- **Effects:**\n  - `styled ?h ?style`: The hair is transformed into the desired hairstyle.\n  - `knows_advanced_style ?p ?style`: The person improves their skill or gains knowledge of the advanced hairstyle.\n  - `updated_components ?h ?components`: The components used in the hairstyle are updated to reflect the new style.\n  - `not (natural_hair ?h)`: The hair is no longer in its natural state.\n\n#### **Core Logic**\n- The action retains the core logic of preconditions and effects to ensure consistency across tasks. For example:\n  - The condition `knows_style ?p ?style` ensures that a person cannot create a style they do not already know.\n  - The effect `styled ?h ?style` reflects the state change of the hair being styled.\n\n#### **Avoid Redundancy**\n- All similar effects, such as styling the hair into a particular form or transitioning the hair state, are unified under the `styled ?h ?style` and `updated_components ?h ?components` effects.\n- Preconditions and effects dealing with specific hairstyles (e.g., braided headband, cornrows, fishtail braids) are generalized to use abstract parameters like `?style` and `?components`.\n\n#### **Logical Consistency**\n- Logical consistency is maintained by ensuring the preconditions and effects align with the task's requirements. For example:\n  - The precondition `valid_components ?h ?style ?components` ensures that only appropriate components (e.g., Dutch braids for a braided crown) are used.\n  - The effect `knows_advanced_style ?p ?style` reflects a logical progression of skill acquisition.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Covers the Original Actions:\n\nHere\u2019s how the merged action generalizes and simplifies the original actions:\n\n#### **Original Action: switch_braid_length_and_style**\n- The `create` action allows for switching styles and lengths as part of `valid_components ?h ?style ?components` and `updated_components ?h ?components`.\n\n#### **Original Action: create-braided-headband**\n- The `create` action supports creating a braided headband by setting `?style` to `braided_headband` and ensuring the person knows the waterfall braid technique (`knows_style ?p ?style`).\n\n#### **Original Action: create_box_braids**\n- Supported by setting `?style` to `box_braids` and validating the components (`valid_components ?h ?style ?components`).\n\n#### **Original Action: create_cornrows**\n- Supported by specifying `?style` as `cornrows` and using the appropriate components.\n\n#### **Original Action: create_braided_crown**\n- The braided crown is created by setting `?style` to `braided_crown` and ensuring `?components` include two Dutch braids.\n\n#### **Original Action: create_upside_down_braid**\n- The upside-down braid is created by setting `?style` to `upside_down_braid`.\n\n#### **Original Action: make_topsy_turvy_ponytail**\n- The topsy-turvy ponytail can be modeled by setting `?style` to `topsy_turvy_ponytail`.\n\n#### **Original Action: make_fishtail_braid**\n- The fishtail braid is created by setting `?style` to `fishtail_braid`.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of the Merged Action:\n1. **Flexibility:** The `create` action can adapt to a wide variety of tasks by simply changing the `?style` and `?components` parameters.\n2. **Simplicity:** Redundant effects and preconditions are removed, resulting in a more concise and efficient action.\n3. **Scalability:** New hairstyles can be added by introducing new `?style` values without modifying the action logic.\n4. **Consistency:** Logical consistency is maintained across different hairstyles through the use of abstract parameters and effects.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like further refinements or additional examples!",
    "Here\u2019s how we can merge **learning-related actions** into a single universal `learn` action while ensuring generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: Learn**\n```lisp\n(:action learn\n  :parameters (?entity - agent ?skill - skill ?resource - resource)\n  :precondition (and\n                  (not (knows ?entity ?skill))     ; The entity does not know the skill yet\n                  (prepared ?resource ?skill)      ; The resource is in the required state for learning\n                )\n  :effect (and\n            (knows ?entity ?skill)                ; The entity acquires the skill\n            (transformed ?resource ?skill)        ; The resource's state changes based on the skill learned\n          )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action**\n#### **1. Generality**\n- **Abstract Parameters**: \n  - `?entity`: Represents the learning agent (e.g., a person, robot, etc.)\n  - `?skill`: Represents the skill or knowledge to be acquired (e.g., \"Dutch braid,\" \"Waterfall braid,\" etc.)\n  - `?resource`: Represents the resource or object involved in the learning process (e.g., hair, a book, a machine, etc.)\n- This abstraction allows the action to apply to any learning process across tasks.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Preconditions**\n- `(not (knows ?entity ?skill))`: Ensures the action is only applicable if the entity does not already know the skill.\n- `(prepared ?resource ?skill)`: Represents the condition that the resource must be in the correct state to facilitate learning. For example:\n  - For learning a Dutch braid, the hair must be straight and prepared.\n  - For learning a new recipe, the ingredients might need to be ready.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Effects**\n- `(knows ?entity ?skill)`: Captures the state change where the entity gains the skill.\n- `(transformed ?resource ?skill)`: Represents the transformation of the resource as part of the learning process. For example:\n  - Hair becomes sectioned after learning the Dutch braid.\n  - Ingredients might be mixed after learning a recipe.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of How the Merged Action Applies**\n#### **Case 1: Dutch Braid**\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(not (knows ?p Dutch-braid))`: The person does not know how to Dutch braid.\n  - `(prepared ?h Dutch-braid)`: The hair is straight and ready for braiding.\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(knows ?p Dutch-braid)`: The person learns the Dutch braid technique.\n  - `(transformed ?h Dutch-braid)`: The hair becomes sectioned as part of the braiding process.\n\n#### **Case 2: Waterfall Braid**\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `(not (knows ?p Waterfall-braid))`: The person does not know how to do a waterfall braid.\n  - `(prepared ?h Waterfall-braid)`: The hair is in the required state (e.g., brushed and detangled).\n- **Effects**:\n  - `(knows ?p Waterfall-braid)`: The person learns the waterfall braid technique.\n  - `(transformed ?h Waterfall-braid)`: The hair becomes styled in a waterfall braid.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Merged Action Works**\n- **Generality**: The action can handle any learning process by abstracting the agent, skill, and resource.\n- **State Change**: Clearly defines the preconditions and effects of the learning process, ensuring the entity progresses toward the goal state (acquiring the skill).\n- **Simplicity**: Combines similar actions into a single, reusable action, avoiding redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logically tied to the learning process and can adapt to different contexts by defining specific skill-resource relationships (e.g., hair for braiding, books for knowledge).\n\n",

This action is designed to be adaptable across various tasks, with abstract parameters that allow it to represent tasks such as dividing a section, checking a resource, or updating task statuses.

State Change:**\n   - The precondition `current_state` ensures the action is only applicable when the actor, target, and context are in a specific starting configuration.\n   - The `not (desired_state)` precondition prevents redundancy by ensuring the action has not already been completed.\n   - The effect `desired_state` signifies that the action updates the state to the goal or desired state.\n\n#### **3. Core Logic:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are cleanly defined to ensure logical consistency.\n   - The core logic of checking, modifying, or advancing an entity\u2019s state is preserved.\n\n#### **4. Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - Similar actions (e.g., `check_bestseller_list`, `listen_to_member_secret`, `ContinueKnotting`, `TieBraidOff`) are merged by abstracting their parameters and focusing on the state change they represent rather than their domain-specific details.\n\n#### **5. Logical Consistency:**\n   - The action is logically consistent across tasks, as it requires the current state to match a specific configuration before proceeding.\n   - The effect always transforms the state to reflect progress toward a goal.\n\n---\n\n### **Examples of Contextual Adaptation:**\n\n#### **1.

The generality of the parameters and logic allows it to adapt to diverse scenarios.\n\n2. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters such as `?section` (representing any braid section) and `?tool` (representing any object like an elastic or other tools). This ensures that the action applies to various tasks without limiting it to specific braid or tool types.\n\n3. **Preconditions**:\n   - The preconditions check that the braid section is in a prepared state (`prepared ?section`) but not yet finalized (`not (finalized ?section)`), which covers the conditions for both `TieBraidOff` and `BraidOtherSection`.\n\n4. **Effects**:\n   - The effect of the action transitions the braid section from its current state to a finalized state (`finalized ?section`). This captures the state change for tying off or completing actions.\n\n5. **Simplicity**:\n   - By merging the logic of tying off and preparing other sections into a single, universal action, redundancy is avoided, and the action becomes simpler and more efficient.\n\n6. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects remain consistent across different tasks, ensuring that the logic applies to both tying off completed braids and handling other braid sections.\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage\n\n#### Scenario 1: Tying Off a Completed Braid\n- Parameters: `?section = braid1`, `?tool = elastic1`\n- Preconditions: `(prepared braid1)` and `(not (finalized braid1))`\n- Effects: `(finalized braid1)`\n\n#### Scenario 2: Finalizing Another Braid Section\n- Parameters: `?section = braid2`, `?tool = elastic2`\n- Preconditions: `(prepared braid2)` and `(not (finalized braid2))`\n- Effects: `(finalized braid2)`\n\n---\n\nBy merging the actions into `manage_braid_section`, we achieve a universal, adaptable action that adheres to the principles of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.",

It uses general parameters like `?entity` (the object being transformed), `?context` (the relevant environment or condition), and `?state` (the property or predicate being applied to the entity).\n   - It can represent a variety of tasks, such as checking a resource, assigning roles, braiding hair, or any other task where the state of an entity changes within a context.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition ensures that the desired state `?state` is not already true for the entity in the given context.\n   - The effect applies the state change, ensuring that the entity's state is updated in relation to the context.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action removes redundant and specific details from the individual actions while keeping the core logic intact.\n   - By using abstract parameters, it captures the essence of the state transformation process without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the action is only applied in valid contexts (e.g., `valid_context` ensures logical applicability of the action).\n   - The effect guarantees that the state of the entity is updated consistently.\n\n---\n\n### Example Application:\n\n1. **Checking a Bestseller List:**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action Transform\n        :parameters (?npc - person ?book - book ?state - predicate)\n        :precondition (and (not (?state ?npc ?book)) (valid_context ?book ?npc))\n        :effect (and (?state ?npc ?book))\n    )\n    ```\n\n    - Here, `?entity` is `?npc`, `?context` is `?book`, and `?state` is `(checked_list)`. This allows the action to represent the task of checking the bestseller list.\n\n2. **Braiding Hair:**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action Transform\n        :parameters (?section - hair ?hair - object ?state - predicate)\n        :precondition (and (not (?state ?section ?hair)) (valid_context ?hair ?section))\n        :effect (and (?state ?section ?hair))\n    )\n    ```\n\n    - Here, `?entity` is `?section`, `?context` is `?hair`, and `?state` is `(braided)`. This allows the action to represent the task of braiding a section of hair.\n\n3. **Assigning a Loan Tracker:**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action Transform\n        :parameters (?member - person ?club - book_club ?state - predicate)\n        :precondition (and (not (?state ?member ?club)) (valid_context ?club ?member))\n        :effect (and (?state ?member ?club))\n    )\n    ```\n\n    - Here, `?entity` is `?member`, `?context` is `?club`, and `?state` is `(loan_tracker)`. This allows the action to represent the task of assigning a member as a loan tracker.\n\n---\n\n### Key Benefits of the Merged Action:\n\n- **Reusability:** The abstract nature of the `Transform` action allows it to be reused across a wide range of tasks.\n- **Clarity:** The preconditions and effects are straightforward, ensuring clarity in how the state of an entity is changed.\n- **Efficiency:** By merging similar actions into one, redundancy is eliminated, and the action set is streamlined for better performance and maintainability.\n\n",
    "To merge the actions into a single universal action for \"GatherHair\" while adhering to the outlined guidelines, here's how the merged action would look:\n\n### Merged Universal Action: `ManageHairState`\n\n```lisp\n(:action ManageHairState ; Manage the state of hair (e.g., braid, gather, twist into a bun)\n    :parameters (?h - hair ?s1 - state ?s2 - state ?style - hairstyle)\n    :precondition (and (has_state ?h ?s1) (not (has_state ?h ?s2)) (compatible ?s1 ?s2 ?style))\n    :effect (and (not (has_state ?h ?s1)) (has_state ?h ?s2) (style_applied ?h ?style))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The `ManageHairState` action is abstract and adaptable to various tasks, such as braiding, gathering, or twisting hair into a bun.\n   - It uses abstract parameters like `?h` (hair), `?s1` (current state), `?s2` (target state), and `?style` (specific hairstyle) to generalize the hair management process.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the hair is in the current state (`?s1`) and not already in the target state (`?s2`).\n   - The effect describes the transformation by removing the current state (`not (has_state ?h ?s1)`) and adding the target state (`has_state ?h ?s2`), while also associating the hair with the applied style (`style_applied ?h ?style`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - This universal action eliminates redundancy by combining similar logic for tasks like gathering and twisting hair.\n   - It introduces a `compatible` predicate to ensure logical consistency between the states and styles (e.g., you cannot gather unbraided hair).\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The `compatible` predicate ensures that the transition from one state to another is reasonable (e.g., braided hair can be gathered into a ponytail or twisted into a bun).\n   - The preconditions and effects are clear and logically consistent across different contexts.\n\n### Example Instantiations:\n- If the task is to **gather braided hair into a ponytail:**\n  ```lisp\n  (:action GatherBraidedHair\n      :parameters (?h - hair ?p - ponytail)\n      :precondition (and (has_state ?h braided) (not (has_state ?h gathered)) (compatible braided gathered ponytail))\n      :effect (and (not (has_state ?h braided)) (has_state ?h gathered) (style_applied ?h ponytail))\n  )\n  ```\n\n- If the task is to **twist gathered hair into a bun:**\n  ```lisp\n  (:action TwistHairIntoBun\n      :parameters (?h - hair ?b - bun)\n      :precondition (and (has_state ?h gathered) (not (has_state ?h twisted)) (compatible gathered twisted bun))\n      :effect (and (not (has_state ?h gathered)) (has_state ?h twisted) (style_applied ?h bun))\n  )\n  ```\n\n### Why This Works:\n- This merged action can handle all hair-related tasks (braiding, gathering, twisting into a bun) by abstracting the states and styles.\n- The `compatible` predicate ensures logical transitions, while the universal structure avoids redundancy and maintains clarity.\n- The action is simple yet flexible, making it applicable to a wide range of hair management tasks.",
    "Here is the merged **\"TwistIntoBun\"** action, following the guidelines to create a universal and abstract action that maintains generality, logical consistency, simplicity, and avoids redundancy:\n\n---\n\n```pddl\n(:action TwistIntoBun\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?state1 - state ?state2 - state)\n    :precondition (and (in_state ?entity ?state1) (not (in_state ?entity ?state2)))\n    :effect (and (not (in_state ?entity ?state1)) (in_state ?entity ?state2))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:  \n   - The parameters are abstract (`?entity`, `?state1`, and `?state2`), allowing this action to apply to a variety of tasks, not just twisting a ponytail into a bun. Any object (`?entity`) transitioning between two states (`?state1` to `?state2`) can use this action. For example:\n     - Ponytail \u2192 Bun (`gathered` \u2192 `twisted`)\n     - Hair sections \u2192 Braided (`separated` \u2192 `braided`)\n     - Book \u2192 Loaned (`available` \u2192 `loaned`)\n\n2. **State Change**:  \n   - The precondition ensures that the entity is in a specific initial state (`?state1`) and is not yet in the target state (`?state2`).\n   - The effect transforms the entity's state by removing the initial state (`not (in_state ?entity ?state1)`) and adding the target state (`in_state ?entity ?state2`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:  \n   - Redundancies are removed by combining similar state transitions (e.g., gathered \u2192 twisted, separated \u2192 braided) into a single universal structure.\n   - The core logic is preserved while avoiding unnecessary specification of actions like \"gather,\" \"twist,\" or \"braid\" individually.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:  \n   - The preconditions and effects are consistently defined using the abstract state transitions, ensuring logical applicability across contexts.\n\n---\n\n### How this merged action applies to different tasks:\n1. **Twisting a ponytail into a bun**:  \n   - `?entity = ?b` (bun), `?state1 = gathered`, `?state2 = twisted`\n\n2. **Braiding hair sections**:  \n   - `?entity = ?hair_section`, `?state1 = separated`, `?state2 = braided`\n\n3. **Changing book status to \"loaned\"**:  \n   - `?entity = ?book`, `?state1 = available`, `?state2 = loaned`\n\n4. **Checking an item status**:  \n   - `?entity = ?item`, `?state1 = unchecked`, `?state2 = checked`\n\nBy defining a universal action like this, it becomes adaptable to any task that involves transitioning an entity from one state to another. This results in a highly reusable and efficient action for a variety of PDDL tasks.",
    "Here's the merged action based on the provided action set for `GatherHairAtCrown`:\n\n```lisp\n(:action GatherHairAtCrown ; Gather hair into a specific position and prepare for styling\n    :parameters (?h - hair ?p - person)\n    :precondition (and (loose ?h) (not (styled ?h)) (at_position ?h ?p))\n    :effect (and (gathered ?h) (styling_started ?h))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality:** \n   - The action has been generalized to apply to any scenario involving gathering and styling hair. The specific terms like \"braided\" have been abstracted to \"styled,\" and \"at_crown\" has been generalized to \"at_position\" to increase flexibility.\n   - This allows the action to be reused for tasks beyond just braiding hair at the crown, such as preparing hair for other styles or positions.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions such as `loose ?h` ensure that the hair is in a state that can be gathered.\n   - The effect `gathered ?h` indicates the hair is now gathered, and `styling_started ?h` marks the start of a styling process.\n   - This gradual transformation aligns with the guidelines of progressing toward a goal state.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** \n   - The action avoids unnecessary complexity by abstracting specific conditions into more general ones (e.g., `at_crown` \u2192 `at_position`, `braided` \u2192 `styled`).\n   - Only the core logic is retained, ensuring the action remains efficient and concise.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** \n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent and applicable across different contexts, ensuring adaptability to various tasks involving hair manipulation.\n\nBy merging and generalizing, this action is now a reusable building block for a variety of tasks involving gathering and styling hair.",
    "Here\u2019s the merged action for the provided task \"PullHairFromSides\":\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action PullHairFromSides ; Pull hair from the sides and incorporate into the braid\n    :parameters (?h - hair ?p - person)\n    :precondition (and (loose ?h) (braiding_started ?h) (available_on_sides ?h ?p))\n    :effect (and (added_to_braid ?h) (not (loose ?h)))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\nAfter reviewing the provided example for merging actions and applying the same principles of **generality, simplicity, state change clarity, and logical consistency**, the resulting \"PullHairFromSides\" action remains as is because:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters (`?h` for hair and `?p` for person), making it adaptable to any scenario involving hair braiding.\n2. **State Change**: The action clearly describes the state change:\n   - **Precondition**: The hair must be loose, braiding must have started, and the hair must be available on the sides for the person.\n   - **Effect**: The hair is now added to the braid and is no longer loose.\n3. **Simplicity**: There is no redundancy or unnecessary complexity in the original action.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are reasonable and consistent with the task of pulling hair from the sides for braiding.\n\nSince there were no other actions to be merged into this one, the original action already satisfies the requirements for a clean, universal representation of the \"PullHairFromSides\" task.",
    "Here is the merged action, combining the logic and state transitions of all the provided \"braiding-related\" actions into a single, generalized and universal action:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `ContinueBraiding`\n```pddl\n(:action ContinueBraiding\n    :parameters (?h - hair ?p - person ?source - part)\n    :precondition (and \n        (braiding_started ?h)\n        (not (braided ?h))\n        (loose ?source ?h)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (braided ?h)\n        (not (loose ?source ?h))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The new action `ContinueBraiding` generalizes the process of braiding by using abstract parameters:\n     - `?h` represents the hair being braided.\n     - `?p` represents the person involved in the task (optional for context).\n     - `?source` represents the part of the hair being added to the braid (e.g., \"crown,\" \"sides,\" or other regions).\n   - This allows the action to be used in various braiding tasks, whether it involves starting, pulling, or finishing the braid.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the braiding process has already started (`braiding_started ?h`) and that there is still loose hair available from a specific source (`loose ?source ?h`).\n   - The effects capture the state change: the hair becomes fully braided (`braided ?h`), and the source of the hair is no longer loose (`not (loose ?source ?h)`).\n\n3. **Simplicity and Avoiding Redundancy:**\n   - The previous actions (`GatherHairAtCrown`, `PullHairFromSides`, and `ContinueBraiding`) have overlapping functionality, as they all describe the process of braiding hair in stages. This merged action simplifies and unifies those steps into one action.\n   - By removing unnecessary distinctions between \"starting\" and \"continuing\" the braid, the action remains efficient and avoids redundancy.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects follow a clear, logical progression: braiding starts with loose hair and ends when all hair is braided. The state changes are consistent with this process, ensuring the action applies in different contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases for the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Starting the Braid:**\n   - If the braid is just beginning, `braiding_started` would already be true, and the action would proceed to incorporate loose hair from the crown or sides.\n\n2. **Continuing the Braid:**\n   - If the braid is in progress and there is still loose hair, the action can be repeatedly applied until the braid is complete.\n\n3. **Finishing the Braid:**\n   - When no more loose hair remains, the preconditions will no longer be satisfied, signaling that the braiding process is complete.\n\n---\n\nBy combining the actions into this universal `ContinueBraiding` action, we achieve a generalized, efficient, and logically consistent representation of the braiding process in PDDL.",
    "To create the merged \"redo\" action that combines the given actions into a single universal action, we need to abstract the parameters, preconditions, and effects to make the action general and adaptable to a variety of tasks.

This makes the action applicable to a variety of tasks, not just redoing braids.\n   - The precondition `(associated ?entity ?context)` is a general way of linking the entity to its context, such as a braid being around a hairline or any other entity being associated with a specific location, task, or condition.\n   - The condition `(requires_redo ?entity)` generalizes the concept of something needing to be redone, such as being messy, broken, or incomplete.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The preconditions ensure that the entity is associated with the given context and that it requires a redo.\n   - The effects update the entity's state to be \"fixed\" (or transformed) and remove the condition that it \"requires_redo,\" reflecting the completion of the redo process.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity by merging the core logic of similar actions into one reusable template.\n   - The parameters and predicates are abstract and can be adapted to different tasks.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and logical across various contexts. For example, whether redoing braids, fixing a broken object, or reworking a task, the logic of \"requires_redo\" and \"fixed\" remains universally applicable.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases for the Merged \"redo\" Action:\n\n1. **Redo Braids Around a Hairline**:\n   - Parameters: `?entity = braid1`, `?context = hairline1`\n   - Preconditions: `(associated braid1 hairline1)`, `(requires_redo braid1)`\n   - Effects: `(fixed braid1)`, `(not (requires_redo braid1))`\n\n2. **Redo a Broken Chair**:\n   - Parameters: `?entity = chair1`, `?context = room1`\n   - Preconditions: `(associated chair1 room1)`, `(requires_redo chair1)`\n   - Effects: `(fixed chair1)`, `(not (requires_redo chair1))`\n\n3. **Redo a Messy Painting**:\n   - Parameters: `?entity = painting1`, `?context = studio1`\n   - Preconditions: `(associated painting1 studio1)`, `(requires_redo painting1)`\n   - Effects: `(fixed painting1)`, `(not (requires_redo painting1))`\n\n---\n\nThis merged \"redo\" action is now a versatile template that can be reused for various tasks requiring a redo or fix, ensuring efficiency and adaptability.",
    "To merge the provided actions while adhering to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we will create a single universal action that abstracts the key elements of the provided tasks. Here's how the merged action would look:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action Name: `style_cornrows`\n\n#### Description:\nThis action represents a generic process of styling cornrows, transforming their state while incorporating accessories (e.g., beads, elastics). It abstracts specific styles like \"side_swept\" or \"swirl\" into a more generalizable action.\n\n#### Merged Action Representation:\n```lisp\n(:action style_cornrows\n    :parameters (?c - cornrow ?b - bead ?e - elastic ?style - style_type)\n    :precondition (and \n        (location ?b off_strip)\n        (organization ?b random)\n        (shape ?c loose)\n        (style_available ?style)\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (location ?b on_strip)\n        (organization ?b in_order_on_band)\n        (shape ?c banded)\n        (styled ?c ?style)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action uses abstract parameters such as `?style` (e.g., side_swept, swirl, etc.) to apply to a variety of cornrow styling tasks.\n   - It avoids hardcoding specific styles, making it adaptable for future tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the input state is well-defined, such as beads being \"off_strip\" and cornrows being \"loose.\"\n   - The effects transform the state to reflect the styled outcome: beads are now \"on_strip,\" their organization is \"in_order_on_band,\" the cornrows are \"banded,\" and the specific style (`?style`) is applied.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundant details from the original actions have been removed. For example, both actions transform the beads' location and organization, as well as the cornrows' shape, so this has been generalized into a single set of effects.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts, ensuring the action remains valid for various styling tasks.\n   - The `style_available` predicate ensures that only valid styles are used.\n\n---\n\n### How This Merged Action Works in Practice:\n\n- You'd define specific styles as instances of the `style_type` predicate, such as `(style_type side_swept)` or `(style_type swirl)`.\n- The same action can then be used to style cornrows in various ways by passing the appropriate `?style` parameter.\n- Example instantiation of the action for side-swept cornrows:\n  ```lisp\n  (:action style_cornrows\n      :parameters (?c cornrow1 ?b bead1 ?e elastic1 ?style side_swept)\n      :precondition (and \n          (location bead1 off_strip)\n          (organization bead1 random)\n          (shape cornrow1 loose)\n          (style_available side_swept)\n      )\n      :effect (and \n          (location bead1 on_strip)\n          (organization bead1 in_order_on_band)\n          (shape cornrow1 banded)\n          (styled cornrow1 side_swept)\n      )\n  )\n  ```\n\nThis merged action achieves the goal of combining the two specific actions (`side_swept_cornrows` and `swirl_cornrows`) into a single universal and adaptable action while maintaining clarity and efficiency.",

    "Here is the universal merged action for **PlaitHair**, following the provided guidelines for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency:\n\n---\n\n```pddl\n(:action transform\n  ; Transform a resource or entity's state\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?owner - agent)\n  :precondition (and (modifiable ?entity) (belongs_to ?entity ?owner) (not (transformed ?entity)))\n  :effect (transformed ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action is named `transform` to generalize the concept of modifying or changing the state of an entity.\n   - Abstract parameters (`?entity` and `?owner`) are introduced to make the action adaptable to various tasks beyond just plaiting hair. For example, `?entity` could represent hair, a book, a resource, etc.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the entity is in a state where it can be modified (`modifiable ?entity`) and that the entity belongs to the owner (`belongs_to ?entity ?owner`).\n   - The effect reflects the transformation of the entity (`transformed ?entity`).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action avoids introducing redundant or task-specific conditions, focusing on the core logic of state transformation for an entity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects maintain a consistent and logical flow, ensuring that the action can be applied across different contexts without ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Case:\n\n#### Original Action: Plait Hair\n```pddl\n(:action transform\n  :parameters (?h - hair ?p - person)\n  :precondition (and (modifiable ?h) (belongs_to ?h ?p) (not (transformed ?h)))\n  :effect (transformed ?h)\n)\n```\n\nHere, `?h` corresponds to hair, and `?p` corresponds to the person whose hair is being plaited. Preconditions like `modifiable` map to `separated`, and `belongs_to` maps to `on_head`. The effect `transformed ?h` corresponds to `plaited ?h`.\n\n---\n\nThis approach ensures flexibility and adaptability for a variety of tasks, adhering to the guidelines provided.",
    "To merge the actions into a single **universal action** while maintaining generality, logical consistency, and ensuring adaptability to various tasks, the following action is proposed. This merged action integrates the sequential logic of the hair preparation and plaiting task into a single, general-purpose framework.\n\n```pddl\n(:action TransformEntity\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?state1 - state ?state2 - state ?context - context)\n  :precondition (and \n                 (in_state ?entity ?state1)\n                 (valid_context ?context ?entity ?state1 ?state2)\n                 (not (in_state ?entity ?state2)))\n  :effect (and \n           (not (in_state ?entity ?state1))\n           (in_state ?entity ?state2)\n           (updated_context ?context ?entity ?state2)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Universal Action:\n\n1. **Action Name**: `TransformEntity`\n   - The name is intentionally abstract to represent any action that transitions an entity from one state to another.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - `?entity`: Represents the object being acted upon (e.g., hair, book, player).\n   - `?state1`: The initial state of the entity before the action.\n   - `?state2`: The target state of the entity after the action.\n   - `?context`: Represents the broader context or environment in which the transformation occurs (e.g., a person, a book club, or a task environment).\n\n3. **Preconditions**:\n   - `(in_state ?entity ?state1)`: The entity must currently be in the initial state (`?state1`).\n   - `(valid_context ?context ?entity ?state1 ?state2)`: The context must permit the transition from `?state1` to `?state2` for the given entity.\n   - `(not (in_state ?entity ?state2))`: The entity must not already be in the target state (`?state2`), avoiding redundancy.\n\n4. **Effects**:\n   - `(not (in_state ?entity ?state1))`: The entity is no longer in the initial state (`?state1`).\n   - `(in_state ?entity ?state2)`: The entity is now in the target state (`?state2`).\n   - `(updated_context ?context ?entity ?state2)`: Optionally, the context is updated to reflect the new state of the entity.\n\n---\n\n### Application to Merged Actions:\n\n#### **Hair Plaiting Task**:\nBy substituting parameters:\n- `?entity` = `?h` (hair)\n- `?state1` = smooth \u2192 separated \u2192 plaited \u2192 secured\n- `?state2` = separated \u2192 plaited \u2192 secured \u2192 completed\n- `?context` = `?p` (person)\nThe action can handle each step of the hair plaiting task by progressively transforming the state of the hair (`?h`) while adhering to the logical progression of preconditions and effects.\n\n#### **Checking Task**:\nBy substituting parameters:\n- `?entity` = `?item` (e.g., book)\n- `?state1` = unchecked\n- `?state2` = checked\n- `?context` = `?npc` (person)\nThe action can adapt to checking tasks by ensuring an item transitions from an unchecked state to a checked state.\n\n#### **Loan Tracker Task**:\nBy substituting parameters:\n- `?entity` = `?member` (player)\n- `?state1` = not a loan tracker\n- `?state2` = loan tracker\n- `?context` = `?bc` (book club)\nThe action can assign a member as a loan tracker by transitioning their state accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality**: The action applies to a wide variety of tasks by abstracting parameters and states.\n2. **State Change**: Clearly defines how the entity's state evolves.\n3. **Simplicity**: Avoids redundancy by consolidating multiple actions into a single, reusable framework.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Ensures that preconditions and effects are logically connected and adaptable to different tasks. \n\nThis universal action provides a flexible template for capturing and transforming the state of any entity in a given context, enabling efficient modeling of diverse domains.",
    "(:action fashion_bracelet ; Fashion an item from materials\n    :parameters (?material - object ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and (prepared ?material) (not (fashioned ?item)))\n    :effect (fashioned ?item))",
    "Here's the merged action following the described guidelines for the task `MakeNecklace`:\n\n### Merged Action:\n```lisp\n(:action MakeNecklace ; Create an object by transforming resources\n    :parameters (?resource - object ?product - object)\n    :precondition (and (transformed ?resource) (not (created ?product)))\n    :effect (and (created ?product))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?resource` and `?product` are abstract, making the action adaptable to tasks beyond just making necklaces (e.g., transforming any type of resource into a product).\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(transformed ?resource)` represents that the resource has undergone some preliminary transformation (like braiding leather in the original action), and the effect `(created ?product)` indicates that the final product is completed.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundant specifics like `?l - leather` or `?n - necklace`, generalizing the terms to `?resource` and `?product` while retaining clarity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logic is preserved\u2014resources must be in a specific state (precondition) before they can be used to create a product (effect). There\u2019s no unnecessary complexity, and the action maintains its integrity in different contexts.",
    "The merged action after combining **FashionBracelet**, **MakeNecklace**, and **CreateLeatherRing** into a single universal action is as follows:\n\n```lisp\n(:action fashion_leather_item\n    :parameters (?l - leather ?item - accessory)\n    :precondition (and (braided ?l) (not (fashioned ?item)))\n    :effect (fashioned ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Action Name**:\n   - The merged action is named `fashion_leather_item`, which generalizes the process of creating any accessory (e.g., ring, bracelet, necklace) from braided leather.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - `?l`: Represents the braided leather being used.\n   - `?item`: Represents the accessory being created (e.g., ring, bracelet, or necklace). The type `accessory` is used to generalize all possible items being fashioned.\n\n3. **Preconditions**:\n   - The leather `?l` must be `braided` to ensure it is ready for crafting.\n   - The `?item` must not already be `fashioned` to avoid redundant actions.\n\n4. **Effects**:\n   - The action results in the `?item` being marked as `fashioned`, signifying the completion of the crafting process.\n\n---\n\n### Features of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - By using the abstract parameter `?item` of type `accessory`, the action can be applied to any leather-based accessory (bracelet, necklace, ring, etc.).\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action clearly describes the transformation of the state from `not (fashioned ?item)` to `fashioned ?item`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant and specific actions are merged into one, ensuring simplicity and reusability without repeating similar logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent with the original actions, ensuring the merged action works in the same logical context.\n\n---\n\n### How the Merged Action Works in Different Contexts:\n- If the accessory is a **bracelet**, the action would be invoked as:\n  ```lisp\n  (:action fashion_leather_item\n      :parameters (?l - leather ?b - bracelet)\n      :precondition (and (braided ?l) (not (fashioned ?b)))\n      :effect (fashioned ?b)\n  )\n  ```\n- If the accessory is a **ring**, the action would be:\n  ```lisp\n  (:action fashion_leather_item\n      :parameters (?l - leather ?r - ring)\n      :precondition (and (braided ?l) (not (fashioned ?r)))\n      :effect (fashioned ?r)\n  )\n  ```\n- If the accessory is a **necklace**, it would be:\n  ```lisp\n  (:action fashion_leather_item\n      :parameters (?l - leather ?n - necklace)\n      :precondition (and (braided ?l) (not (fashioned ?n)))\n      :effect (fashioned ?n)\n  )\n  ```\n\nThis flexibility ensures the merged action can adapt to different tasks while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity."

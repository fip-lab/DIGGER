    "Here\u2019s how I would merge the provided actions under the requested guidelines:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action Name: `look`\n\n#### Merged Actions:  \n1. **Look at Bestseller List** \u2013 Gather information about the bestseller list for a book club.  \n2. **Ask for a Recommendation** \u2013 Request recommendations for a specific task, generalizing the idea of obtaining information.  \n\n---\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action look ; Look for information or recommendations\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?source - object ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and \n        (member ?agent ?context) \n        (not (has_info ?context ?source))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (has_info ?context ?source)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:  \n   The action is designed to cover multiple cases of gathering information, whether it's by looking at a bestseller list or asking for a recommendation. The use of abstract parameters (`?agent`, `?source`, `?context`) ensures the action is adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:  \n   The state change is clearly defined: the `?context` (e.g., a book club) will gain new information (`has_info ?context ?source`) after the action is executed.\n\n3. **Core Logic**:  \n   The precondition ensures the `?agent` is a valid participant in the `?context` and that the required information hasn\u2019t already been acquired. The effect updates the state to reflect that the information is now available.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**:  \n   The two original actions shared a similar purpose (obtaining information), so they were merged into a single, generalizable action. This avoids redundant definitions.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**:  \n   The merged action maintains consistency across contexts, as the preconditions and effects are structured to allow for flexibility without becoming ambiguous. The abstract parameters and logical flow ensure it can apply to different scenarios.\n\n---\n\n### Application of the Merged Action:\n\n- **Looking at a Bestseller List**:  \n   - `?agent`: A book club member.  \n   - `?source`: The bestseller list.  \n   - `?context`: The book club.  \n\n- **Asking for a Recommendation**:  \n   - `?agent`: A person seeking advice.  \n   - `?source`: A recommendation source (e.g., another book club member).  \n   - `?context`: The relevant context (e.g., a book club or a discussion group).  \n\n",
    "Here's the merged action that combines the `ask_for_recommendation`, `ask_for_opinions`, and `ask_for_suggestions` actions into a single universal `ask` action:\n\n```lisp\n(:action ask ; Ask for information, opinions, or suggestions\n    :parameters (?asker - person ?responder - person ?item - object ?context - group)\n    :precondition (and \n        (in ?asker ?context) \n        (in ?responder ?context) \n        (or \n            (and (not (has_recommendation ?context)) (member ?asker ?context) (member ?responder ?context)) ; Asking for recommendations\n            (and (chosen ?item) (not (has_opinion ?responder ?item))) ; Asking for opinions on an item\n            (and (not (suggestions_requested ?context))) ; Asking for suggestions\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or \n            (has_recommendation ?context) ; Recommendation asked and received\n            (has_opinion ?responder ?item) ; Opinion on an item received\n            (and (suggestions_requested ?context) (suggestions_received ?context)) ; Suggestions asked and received\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The merged `ask` action uses abstract parameters (`?asker`, `?responder`, `?item`, `?context`) to generalize across various use cases (recommendations, opinions, suggestions).\n   - It can apply to different tasks, as long as they involve asking for information, opinions, or suggestions.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The action ensures that the state progresses by updating the relevant predicate (`has_recommendation`, `has_opinion`, or `suggestions_requested` and `suggestions_received`) based on the context.\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - The action retains the core logic of the preconditions and effects from the original actions:\n     - For recommendations: The asker and responder must both be members of the same group (`?context`), and the group must not already have a recommendation.\n     - For opinions: The item must be chosen, and the responder must not yet have an opinion on it.\n     - For suggestions: The group must not have requested suggestions yet.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by combining the similar effects of the original actions into a single unified effect structure, using logical conditions.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent and adaptable to different contexts, ensuring the action can be applied without conflict.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n- **Scenario 1 (Ask for Recommendation):**\n  - Parameters: `?asker = Alice`, `?responder = Bob`, `?item = null`, `?context = BookClub1`\n  - Preconditions:\n    - Alice and Bob are members of `BookClub1`.\n    - `BookClub1` does not already have a recommendation.\n  - Effect:\n    - `has_recommendation(BookClub1)` is added to the state.\n\n- **Scenario 2 (Ask for Opinion):**\n  - Parameters: `?asker = Alice`, `?responder = Bob`, `?item = BookA`, `?context = BookClub1`\n  - Preconditions:\n    - Bob is in `BookClub1`.\n    - `BookA` is chosen, and Bob has no opinion on it.\n  - Effect:\n    - `has_opinion(Bob, BookA)` is added to the state.\n\n- **Scenario 3 (Ask for Suggestions):**\n  - Parameters: `?asker = Alice`, `?responder = null`, `?item = null`, `?context = BookClub1`\n  - Preconditions:\n    - Alice is in `BookClub1`.\n    - Suggestions have not yet been requested for `BookClub1`.\n  - Effect:\n    - `suggestions_requested(BookClub1)` and `suggestions_received(BookClub1)` are added to the state.\n\nThis single, universal `ask` action can now handle a variety of asking-related tasks in a consistent and efficient manner.",
    "Here is the merged action for the `visit` category, following the provided guidelines:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `visit`\n```lisp\n(:action visit ; Visit a resource to gather or update information\n  :parameters (?person - agent ?target - location ?info - information_type)\n  :precondition (and (member ?person ?target) (not (has_info ?target ?info)))\n  :effect (and (has_info ?target ?info))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?person`, `?target`, and `?info`) to generalize the action, ensuring adaptability to various tasks. \n   - Instead of being specific to \"expert websites\" or \"other book clubs,\" it now applies to any scenario where an agent (`?person`) visits a location or resource (`?target`) to collect specific information (`?info`).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The `precondition` ensures that the agent is a member of the target location/resource (`member ?person ?target`) and that the desired information is not already available (`not (has_info ?target ?info)`).\n   - The `effect` reflects the successful acquisition of the information (`has_info ?target ?info`).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action eliminates redundant specificity (e.g., \"expert websites\" or \"other book clubs\"), simplifying the logic while maintaining flexibility.\n   - The use of abstract parameters ensures that the action can be reused in different contexts without additional modifications.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The `precondition` and `effect` maintain consistent and reasonable logic for various scenarios where information is gathered by visiting a resource.\n   - The action ensures that the state change is clear, moving from \"not having the information\" to \"having the information.\"\n\n---\n\n### How the Original Actions Were Merged:\n\n#### 1. `visit_expert_websites`\n```lisp\n(:action visit_expert_websites\n    :parameters (?p - person ?bc - bookclub)\n    :precondition (and (member ?p ?bc) (not (has_expert_info ?bc)))\n    :effect (and (has_expert_info ?bc))\n)\n```\n- This action involved a person visiting a book club to gather \"expert information.\"\n- In the merged action, this was generalized to any type of information (`?info`) and any target resource (`?target`).\n\n#### 2. `find_out_what_other_book_clubs_are_reading`\n- Although the specific action for this task wasn't provided in full, it likely involved a similar structure: an agent gathering information from a resource (e.g., other book clubs) about their reading lists.\n- The merged action abstracts this into a generic process of gathering information from any target about any type of information.\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action Benefits:\n- **Flexibility:** The `visit` action is now capable of handling a wide variety of tasks, from visiting websites to gathering information from other clubs or resources.\n- **Efficiency:** By removing redundant logic and unifying similar actions, the merged action is easier to maintain and integrate into larger PDDL domains.\n- **Clarity:** The abstract parameters and clear preconditions/effects make the logic straightforward and adaptable.\n\n",
    "Here is the merged PDDL action for the **\"select\"** action, combining all the provided actions into a single generalized and universal form. The merged action adheres to the principles of generality, logical consistency, simplicity, and state changes.\n\n```lisp\n(:action select\n    :parameters (?actor - person ?context - context ?item - object)\n    :precondition (and \n        (in ?actor ?context) ; The actor must be part of the relevant context (e.g., book club).\n        (relevant ?item ?context) ; The item must be relevant to the context.\n        (not (selected ?item ?context)) ; The item has not yet been selected in the context.\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (selected ?item ?context) ; The item is now marked as selected in the context.\n        (updated_context ?context ?item)) ; The context is updated to reflect the selection.\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n#### 1. **Generality**:\n   - The use of abstract parameters like `?actor`, `?context`, and `?item` makes this action applicable across a wide range of tasks. For example:\n     - `?actor` could be a player, person, or member.\n     - `?context` could be a book club, a genre, or a specific sub-task.\n     - `?item` could be a book, a theme, a genre, or even snack preferences.\n\n#### 2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition `(not (selected ?item ?context))` ensures the action is only applicable when the item has not yet been selected.\n   - The effect `(selected ?item ?context)` marks the item as selected.\n   - The effect `(updated_context ?context ?item)` ensures the broader context (e.g., book club, task flow) is updated to reflect the item's selection.\n\n#### 3. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The precondition `(in ?actor ?context)` ensures the actor is part of the relevant context (e.g., a member of a book club).\n   - The precondition `(relevant ?item ?context)` ensures the item is meaningful in the given context (e.g., a book must be relevant to the book club's theme or genre).\n\n#### 4. **Avoiding Redundancy**:\n   - By generalizing the action into a single \"select\" action, it avoids the need for multiple similar actions like `choose_complex_books`, `select_books`, `choose_sub_genre`, etc.\n   - All these actions are now represented as instances of this single \"select\" action by substituting appropriate parameters.\n\n#### 5. **Applicability to Original Actions**:\n   - The merged action can replace all the provided actions related to selection. For example:\n     - **Finding out other club books**: Set `?item` to the other club information.\n     - **Choosing complex books**: Set `?item` to a book and ensure `(complex ?item)` is part of the domain model.\n     - **Choosing sub-genres**: Set `?item` to a sub-genre.\n     - **Assigning loan trackers**: Set `?item` to the loan tracker person.\n\n---\n\n### Example Instantiations:\n\n1. **Selecting a Complex Book**:\n```lisp\n(:action select\n    :parameters (?p - person ?bc - book_club ?b - book)\n    :precondition (and \n        (in ?p ?bc) \n        (relevant ?b ?bc) \n        (complex ?b) \n        (not (selected ?b ?bc))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (selected ?b ?bc) \n        (updated_context ?bc ?b))\n)\n```\n\n2. **Choosing a Sub-Genre**:\n```lisp\n(:action select\n    :parameters (?p - person ?bc - book_club ?sg - sub_genre)\n    :precondition (and \n        (in ?p ?bc) \n        (relevant ?sg ?bc) \n        (not (selected ?sg ?bc))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (selected ?sg ?bc) \n        (updated_context ?bc ?sg))\n)\n```\n\n3. **Assigning a Loan Tracker**:\n```lisp\n(:action select\n    :parameters (?p - person ?bc - book_club ?tracker - person)\n    :precondition (and \n        (in ?p ?bc) \n        (relevant ?tracker ?bc) \n        (not (selected ?tracker ?bc))\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (selected ?tracker ?bc) \n        (updated_context ?bc ?tracker))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of all the provided \"select\"-related actions while maintaining simplicity, generality, and logical consistency. It can be adapted to any selection task by appropriately defining the domain-specific predicates (e.g., `relevant`, `complex`, `updated_context`).",
    "Here\u2019s the merged action for the **\"pick\"** action category based on the provided action sets:\n\n### Merged Action: `pick`\n```lisp\n(:action pick ; Pick an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?p - person ?item - object ?context - context)\n  :precondition (and \n    (in_context ?p ?context) ; The person must be in the relevant context (e.g., book club, library, etc.)\n    (relevant ?item ?context) ; The item must be relevant to the context (e.g., matches theme, enjoyed by the person, available, etc.)\n    (not (selected ?item ?context)) ; The item must not already be selected\n  )\n  :effect (and \n    (selected ?item ?context) ; The item is marked as selected\n    (updated_status ?item ?context) ; Update the item's status in the context (e.g., book_selected, loaned, etc.)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The merged `pick` action is generalized to work with any \"item\" (e.g., books, objects) and any \"context\" (e.g., book club, library).\n   - It abstracts away the specific conditions for selecting a book (e.g., \"matches_theme\", \"read_and_enjoyed\", or \"available\") into a general `relevant` predicate. This allows the action to adapt to different contexts flexibly.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The `pick` action transforms the item's state by marking it as `selected`, representing that the item has been chosen in the given context.\n   - An auxiliary effect, `updated_status`, is introduced to capture any additional state updates specific to the context (e.g., `book_selected` in a book club or `loaned` in a library).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar preconditions (e.g., `read_and_enjoyed`, `matches_theme`) into the abstract `relevant` predicate.\n   - Contextual details (e.g., whether it\u2019s a book club or a library) are handled through the `context` parameter and associated predicates.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions ensure that the person is in the appropriate context and that the item is relevant and not already selected.\n   - Effects consistently mark the item as selected and update its status in the context.\n\n### How the Merged Action Maps to Original Actions:\n- **`pick_familiar_book`**: The `relevant` predicate can capture `read_and_enjoyed` for the person within the book club (`context`).\n- **`pick_thematic_book`**: The `relevant` predicate can capture `matches_theme` for the book within the book club (`context`).\n- **`pick_books`**: The `relevant` predicate can capture `available` for the book within the library (`context`).\n\nThis merged action, `pick`, is now a universal abstraction that can handle a variety of picking tasks across different contexts while remaining efficient and logically consistent.",
    "To merge the actions effectively while maintaining generality, logical consistency, simplicity, and state change, we will create a universal action that captures the core logic of \"avoiding\" or \"ensuring\" a desired state. Here's the merged action:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `avoid`\n```pddl\n(:action avoid\n    :parameters (?agent - entity ?context - entity ?state - property)\n    :precondition (and (related ?agent ?context) (not (?state ?context)))\n    :effect (?state ?context))\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The `avoid` action is abstract and adaptable to various tasks. It uses generalized parameters:\n     - `?agent`: Represents the entity performing the action (e.g., a person, player, or club member).\n     - `?context`: Represents the environment or situation the action applies to (e.g., a book club, a specific task, or a state of being).\n     - `?state`: Represents the desired property or state to be achieved or maintained (e.g., `stress_free`, `organized`, etc.).\n   - This allows the action to cover multiple scenarios without being tied to a specific task.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures that the undesired state (e.g., `not (stress_free ?context)`) exists before the action is executed.\n   - The effect achieves the desired state (e.g., `(stress_free ?context)`), ensuring a clear and logical transformation.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action eliminates redundancy by combining similar actions under a single abstract action while keeping the structure simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The use of `related` as a predicate in the precondition ensures that the `?agent` is logically connected to the `?context`. For instance, a person must be a member of the book club (`member ?p ?bc`) to influence its state.\n   - The logic is consistent across different tasks, and the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Example Instantiations of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Avoid Stress**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action avoid_stress\n       :parameters (?p - person ?bc - bookclub)\n       :precondition (and (member ?p ?bc) (not (stress_free ?bc)))\n       :effect (stress_free ?bc))\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure a State (e.g., Organized)**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action avoid_disorganization\n       :parameters (?leader - person ?team - group)\n       :precondition (and (leader ?leader ?team) (not (organized ?team)))\n       :effect (organized ?team))\n   ```\n\n---\n\n### Why This Merged Action Works:\n- It encapsulates the core logic of avoiding an undesired state or ensuring a desired one.\n- It is adaptable to a wide range of scenarios by abstracting the parameters and predicates.\n- It simplifies the action set by merging similar actions into one universal action.\n- It maintains logical consistency and clear state changes, ensuring applicability across multiple use cases.\n\n",
    "After merging the given actions under the objective of creating a universal, adaptable action, here is the resulting action for **strike**:\n\n### Merged Action: `strike`\n\n```lisp\n(:action strike\n    ; Establish agreements or deals to enable specific functionalities or benefits\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?target - entity)\n    :precondition (and (in ?actor ?target) (not (has_deal ?target)))\n    :effect (and (has_deal ?target) (enabled_functionality ?target))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The parameters `?actor` and `?target` are generalized as `agent` and `entity`, making the action applicable across diverse scenarios (e.g., players striking deals with libraries, businesses, or other entities).\n   - The effects are generalized to represent enabling some functionality or benefit (`enabled_functionality ?target`), while still capturing the essence of creating a deal.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The initial state requires the actor to be \"in\" the target location or entity (`in ?actor ?target`) and the target not already having a deal (`not (has_deal ?target)`).\n   - The resulting state ensures the entity has a deal (`has_deal ?target`) and enables additional functionality or benefits (`enabled_functionality ?target`).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Similar effects (e.g., creating a deal, enabling functionality) are merged into a single, concise representation.\n   - Abstract parameters and effects eliminate unnecessary complexity while retaining the core logic.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions and effects remain reasonable and adaptable to different contexts (e.g., deals with libraries, businesses, or other entities).\n   - The merged action maintains logical flow and consistency across scenarios.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible, universal template for tasks involving striking agreements, deals, or enabling functionality in a variety of settings.",
    "Here is the merged universal action for **\"create\"**, following the guidelines provided for generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency.

If not, the action allows it to be updated.\n   - The effect ensures the attribute (`?attribute`) is marked as set with the corresponding value (`?value`).\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by abstracting similar patterns into generalized parameters. For example, instead of having separate actions for setting meeting schedules, rules, or decorations, the `set` action uses the `?attribute` parameter to represent these concepts.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are consistent across different use cases. The organizer (`?p`) must have the authority to make changes, and the book club must meet basic requirements (e.g., having a member list) before attributes can be set.\n\n### How the Merged Action Covers the Original Actions:\n\n1. **Set Book Acquisition Rules**:\n   - `?attribute = book_acquisition_rules`\n   - `?value = true`\n\n2. **Set Meeting Schedule**:\n   - `?attribute = meeting_schedule`\n   - `?value = (?loc ?time)` (location and time)\n\n3. **Set Return Schedule**:\n   - `?attribute = return_schedule`\n   - `?value = ?schedule`\n\n4. **Set Heat Level**:\n   - `?attribute = heat_level`\n   - `?value = true`\n\n5. **Set Book-Themed Decor**:\n   - `?attribute = decor`\n   - `?value = ?decor`\n\n### Notes:\n- The `?attribute` and `?value` parameters are flexible enough to represent any configurable property of the book club.\n- The `set` action ensures all tasks follow a unified structure, promoting reusability and simplicity. This generality makes it adaptable for future tasks that involve setting or configuring attributes for a book club.",

For example:\n     - Taking a request for a book club.\n     - Acquiring a resource for a project.\n     - Assigning a task to a team member.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition ensures that the resource is not already owned by the target (`not (has ?target ?resource)`).\n   - The effect updates the state such that the target now has the resource (`(has ?target ?resource)`).\n\n3. **Core Logic:**\n   - Combines the logic of taking requests and assigning/obtaining resources into a single, consistent action.\n   - Preconditions and effects are simplified without losing any necessary details.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy:**\n   - The merged action removes redundant conditions and effects from the original actions.\n   - It generalizes the notion of \"taking\" such that it applies to any resource or entity, avoiding domain-specific constraints.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions like `(associated ?actor ?target)` ensure that the action is contextually valid (e.g., an actor cannot interact with a target they are not related to).\n   - The action maintains clear and reasonable logic for any domain where entities interact to acquire or assign resources.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Applications of the Merged `take` Action**\n\n1. **Taking Book Club Requests:**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action take\n     :parameters (?p - person ?bc - book_club ?req - request)\n     :precondition (and \n                     (member ?p ?bc)\n                     (not (has_request ?bc ?req)))\n     :effect (and \n              (has_request ?bc ?req))\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Assigning a Task to a Team Member:**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action take\n     :parameters (?manager - agent ?team - group ?task - task)\n     :precondition (and \n                     (manages ?manager ?team)\n                     (not (has_task ?team ?task)))\n     :effect (and \n              (has_task ?team ?task))\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Acquiring a New Resource for a Group:**\n   ```lisp\n   (:action take\n     :parameters (?leader - person ?group - organization ?resource - resource)\n     :precondition (and \n                     (leader_of ?leader ?group)\n                     (not (has_resource ?group ?resource)))\n     :effect (and \n              (has_resource ?group ?resource))\n   )\n   ```\n\n---\n\nBy generalizing and merging the actions, the `take` action becomes highly adaptable and reusable across different domains, while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity.",
    "Based on the provided examples and guidelines, the merged `peruse` action must generalize the essence of reviewing or analyzing resources, ensuring it can apply to broader contexts. Here's the result:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `peruse`\n\n```lisp\n(:action peruse ; Analyze or review a resource and update its status\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?group - collective ?resource - entity)\n    :precondition (and (member ?actor ?group) (not (reviewed ?group ?resource)))\n    :effect (and (reviewed ?group ?resource))\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality**: \n   - Replaced specific terms like `person`, `book_club`, and `resource` with abstract terms like `agent`, `collective`, and `entity`.\n   - This allows the action to apply to a wide range of scenarios where an actor reviews or evaluates a resource within a group context.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The action explicitly transforms the state by marking a resource as reviewed for a group.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Eliminated unnecessary complexity while maintaining the core logic of analyzing/reviewing resources.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the actor is a valid member of the group and the resource has not been reviewed yet.\n   - The effect logically updates the state to reflect that the resource has been reviewed.\n\n---\n\n### Example Applications of the `peruse` Action:\n1. A student reviewing a research paper for their study group.\n2. A librarian evaluating a new book for inclusion in a library's catalog.\n3. A team member analyzing a document for their project team.\n\nThis merged action is flexible, clear, and can adapt to a variety of tasks involving the review or analysis of resources.",
    "Here is the merged action for \"encourage,\" which combines the relevant actions into a universal and adaptable format:\n\n```lisp\n(:action encourage\n    ; Encourage participation and contribution in a group\n    :parameters (?initiator - person ?group - group ?participant - person ?activity - activity)\n    :precondition (and \n        (member ?initiator ?group) ; Initiator must be a member of the group\n        (member ?participant ?group) ; Participant must be a member of the group\n        (not (encouraged ?group ?participant ?activity)) ; Activity must not already be encouraged\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (encouraged ?group ?participant ?activity) ; Mark the activity as encouraged for the participant\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action:**\n\n#### **1. Generality:**\n   - The action is generalized to apply to various contexts where encouragement is needed. It uses abstract parameters like `?initiator`, `?group`, `?participant`, and `?activity` to avoid tying it to a specific situation (e.g., book clubs or questions).\n\n#### **2. State Change:**\n   - The action transitions the state by marking the `?activity` as \"encouraged\" for the `?participant` in the `?group`. This reflects a clear state change toward fostering participation or engagement.\n\n#### **3. Simplicity:**\n   - By merging similar effects (e.g., encouraging questions, fostering contributions), the action avoids redundancy and reduces complexity.\n\n#### **4. Logical Consistency:**\n   - Preconditions ensure that the initiator and participant are both members of the group, and the activity has not already been encouraged. Effects logically follow by updating the state to reflect the encouragement.\n\n---\n\n### **How It Applies to Different Contexts:**\n\n- **Encouraging Questions in a Book Club:**\n  - `?initiator` is the leader, `?group` is the book club, `?participant` is a member, and `?activity` is \"asking questions.\"\n  \n- **Fostering Contributions in a Team:**\n  - `?initiator` is a team leader, `?group` is the team, `?participant` is a member, and `?activity` is \"sharing ideas.\"\n\n- **Supporting Participation in a Workshop:**\n  - `?initiator` is the facilitator, `?group` is the workshop, `?participant` is an attendee, and `?activity` is \"engaging in discussions.\"\n\nThis universal action supports a variety of scenarios where encouraging participation or contribution is the goal.",
    "Here's the merged **`request`** action that combines the provided actions into a single universal action while adhering to the specified guidelines:\n\n---\n\n### **Merged Action: Request**\n```pddl\n(:action request\n    ; Request or assign a task to a person or entity, updating the associated state.\n    :parameters (?requester - person ?receiver - entity ?task - task ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and \n        (in ?requester ?context) ; The requester must be part of the context (e.g., club, library, etc.)\n        (in ?receiver ?context) ; The receiver must also be part of the context\n        (valid_task ?task ?context) ; The task must be valid for the given context\n        (not (completed ?receiver ?task)) ; The task must not already be completed by the receiver\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (completed ?receiver ?task) ; Marks the task as completed by the receiver\n        (not (pending ?receiver ?task)) ; Removes any pending status for the task\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of the Merged Action:**\n\n#### **Generality:**\n- The action uses abstract parameters (`?requester`, `?receiver`, `?task`, and `?context`) to ensure that the action can apply to a wide variety of tasks and scenarios:\n  - `?requester`: The person initiating the request (e.g., a leader, organizer, etc.).\n  - `?receiver`: The entity responsible for completing the task (e.g., a member, librarian, etc.).\n  - `?task`: The specific task being requested (e.g., bringing a discussion question, preparing materials, etc.).\n  - `?context`: The broader context in which the task is being assigned (e.g., a book club, library, etc.).\n\n#### **State Change:**\n- The preconditions ensure that the requester and receiver are part of the same context and that the task is valid and not already completed.\n- The effects update the state to mark the task as completed and remove any pending status for the task.\n\n#### **Simplicity:**\n- This action avoids redundancy by generalizing the logic for requesting or assigning tasks into a single action.\n- The use of abstract parameters allows it to apply to multiple scenarios without requiring separate actions for each type of task.\n\n#### **Logical Consistency:**\n- The preconditions and effects are consistent with the logical flow of requesting a task: verifying the context, ensuring the task is valid and incomplete, and updating the state to reflect task completion.\n\n---\n\n### **How This Action Covers the Original Actions:**\n\n#### **1. Request Discussion Questions:**\n- `?requester`: The organizer or leader of the book club.\n- `?receiver`: The member being asked to bring a question.\n- `?task`: Bringing a discussion question.\n- `?context`: The book club.\n\nThe merged action handles this scenario by ensuring the member is part of the book club (`in ?receiver ?context`), the task is valid (`valid_task ?task ?context`), and the task is marked as completed when done (`completed ?receiver ?task`).\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Ask Each Member to Bring in a Discussion Question:**\n- The same logic applies, but the action can be repeated for each member in the context, ensuring that all members complete the task.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Other Potential Scenarios:**\n- The merged `request` action is flexible enough to handle additional scenarios, such as:\n  - Asking a librarian to prepare books for a meeting.\n  - Requesting opinions or feedback from members.\n  - Assigning roles or responsibilities (e.g., assigning a member to prepare questions).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Merged Action:**\nBy combining the logic of requesting and assigning tasks into one universal `request` action, we achieve a general, simple, and logically consistent representation that can adapt to a variety of tasks in the book club or other contexts. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!",
    "Below is the merged action following the given guidelines for the \"update\" action. The action is designed to be general, adaptable to various tasks, and ensures logical consistency while avoiding redundancy:\n\n---\n\n### Merged Action: `update`\n```pddl\n(:action update ; Perform an update on a resource or system\n    :parameters (?agent - person ?target - entity)\n    :precondition (and \n        (modifiable ?target) ; The target must be modifiable\n        (authorized ?agent ?target) ; The agent must have authorization to update the target\n        (not (updated ?target)) ; Ensure the target has not already been updated\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (updated ?target) ; Mark the target as updated\n        (improved_state ?target) ; Reflect that the state of the target has improved\n    )\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The parameters are abstract (`?agent` and `?target`), allowing this action to be applied to many tasks such as updating a website, system, or any modifiable entity.\n   - The use of predicates like `(modifiable ?target)` and `(authorized ?agent ?target)` ensures the action applies to various contexts.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the target is eligible for an update and the agent is authorized.\n   - Effects capture the state change by marking the target as updated and indicating an improvement in its state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant and overly specific details from the original actions (e.g., specific predicates like `has_website` or `website_inviting`) have been abstracted into general predicates like `modifiable` and `improved_state`.\n   - This makes the action flexible and avoids locking it into a single task.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The action maintains reasonable preconditions and effects. For example, an update can only occur if the target hasn't already been updated, ensuring logical soundness.\n\n---\n\n### How the Original Actions Were Merged:\n1. **`update_website`**:\n   - The specific task of updating a website has been generalized into updating any modifiable entity.\n   - The predicate `(has_website ?bg)` has been replaced with the more general `(modifiable ?target)`.\n\n2. **`market_online_group`** (implied but not fully defined in the prompt):\n   - If this action involved updating a target (like a group or platform), it would also fit under the general framework of `update`.\n   - Specifics about marketing would translate into improving the state of the target.\n\nBy generalizing the parameters and predicates, the `update` action can now apply to updating websites, systems, or any other resource, while maintaining logical consistency and adaptability.\n\nLet me know if you need further refinements!",
    "Here's the merged action for the `market` task based on the guidelines provided:\n\n### Merged Action: `market`\n\n```pddl\n(:action market ; Promote a resource or group to attract attention\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?platform - platform ?actor - person)\n    :precondition (and (has_presence ?entity) (not (promoted ?entity ?platform)) (authorized ?actor ?entity))\n    :effect (and (promoted ?entity ?platform))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Merged Action:\n\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action uses abstract parameters: `?entity` can represent any object that needs promotion (e.g., a book group, an initiative, etc.), and `?platform` represents the platform where the promotion occurs. This makes the action adaptable to a wide range of tasks beyond just book groups.\n   - The `?actor` parameter is introduced to ensure that a specific person or agent is responsible for carrying out the promotion. This adds flexibility for accountability or delegation in multi-agent systems.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition `(not (promoted ?entity ?platform))` ensures the action only applies to entities that have not already been promoted.\n   - The effect `(promoted ?entity ?platform)` captures the state change, marking the entity as promoted on the platform.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar effects (e.g., \"marketed a book group\" and \"promoted an entity\") under the single effect `(promoted ?entity ?platform)`.\n   - Preconditions such as `(has_website ?bg)` are generalized to `(has_presence ?entity)`, making the action applicable to entities with any form of presence (e.g., a website, social media, etc.).\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The precondition `(authorized ?actor ?entity)` ensures logical consistency by requiring the actor to have the authority to promote the entity. This prevents unauthorized promotions in different contexts.\n   - The merged action maintains a clear separation of preconditions and effects, ensuring that it operates consistently across contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Example Use Cases for the `market` Action:\n\n1. **Promoting a Book Group Online:**\n   - Parameters: `?entity = book_group1, ?platform = social_media, ?actor = admin`\n   - Preconditions: `(has_presence book_group1)` and `(authorized admin book_group1)`\n   - Effect: `(promoted book_group1 social_media)`\n\n2. **Advertising an Event:**\n   - Parameters: `?entity = event1, ?platform = email_campaign, ?actor = organizer`\n   - Preconditions: `(has_presence event1)` and `(authorized organizer event1)`\n   - Effect: `(promoted event1 email_campaign)`\n\n3. **Announcing a New Product:**\n   - Parameters: `?entity = product1, ?platform = e_commerce_site, ?actor = marketer`\n   - Preconditions: `(has_presence product1)` and `(authorized marketer product1)`\n   - Effect: `(promoted product1 e_commerce_site)`\n\nThis merged action encompasses the essential logic of all marketing-related tasks while remaining abstract enough to adapt to a variety of scenarios.",
    "Here is the merged action for \"decide,\" following the guidelines provided:\n\n```lisp\n(:action decide ; Decide on a focus or assign a role for a task\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?context - context ?focus - focus_type)\n    :precondition (and (in_context ?actor ?context) (not (has_focus ?context ?focus)))\n    :effect (and (has_focus ?context ?focus))\n)\n```\n\n### Key Explanations:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - Parameters are abstracted to `?actor`, `?context`, and `?focus` to allow the action to be used across a variety of tasks.\n   - For example, `?actor` could represent a person, a group, or an entity depending on the task, while `?context` could represent a group, a project, or an environment.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - The precondition ensures the action is performed only when the `?context` does not already have the desired `?focus`.\n   - The effect updates the state to indicate that the `?context` now has the specified `?focus`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids redundancy by focusing on the core logic of deciding a focus or assigning a role. It does not contain extraneous conditions or overly specific parameters.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - Preconditions require the `?actor` to be within the `?context` and ensure that the `?focus` has not already been assigned.\n   - The effects logically follow by assigning the `?focus` to the `?context`.\n\nThis universal action can now be used for a variety of tasks such as deciding on a book club focus, assigning a project lead, or selecting a thematic direction for a group activity.",

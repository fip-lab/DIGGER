The parameters are abstract (`?actor`, `?item`, `?surface`, `?location`) to allow for multiple tasks.\n   \n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation. The item moves from the inventory to the surface, and its state changes to `cooking`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundant conditions have been merged into more abstract concepts like `appropriate_conditions`, which can encapsulate various specific conditions such as `heated_surface`, `hot_day`, etc.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logical flow ensures that the item is in the inventory initially and ends up on a surface, with its state changing to `cooking`. The conditions for the action to be valid are abstracted into `appropriate_conditions`.\n\n### Preconditions and Effects Breakdown:\n- **Preconditions**:\n  - `inventory ?actor ?item`: The actor has the item.\n  - `is_crackable ?item`: The item is something that can be cracked (e.g., an egg).\n  - `at ?actor ?location`: The actor is at the location.\n  - `at ?surface ?location`: The surface is at the location.\n  - `appropriate_conditions ?surface ?location`: This abstracts conditions like the surface being heated, it being a hot day, etc.\n\n- **Effects**:\n  - `not (inventory ?actor ?item)`: The actor no longer has the item in their inventory.\n  - `on_surface ?item ?surface`: The item is now on the surface.\n  - `cooking ?item`: The item is in the process of cooking.\n  - `state_changed ?item`: This indicates that the item's state has changed as a result of the action.\n\nUsing this merged action, you can handle the diverse tasks of cracking eggs on different surfaces under various conditions in a unified manner.

This merged action is designed to handle shaping or modifying various ingredients and objects in a general and adaptable manner.\n\n```lisp\n(:action shape ; Shape or modify an ingredient or object\n    :parameters (?item - ingredient ?form - form)\n    :precondition (and\n        (prepared ?item)\n        (at ?item workspace)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (shaped ?item ?form)\n        (not (prepared ?item))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action is named `shape` to encompass a broad range of shaping or modifying activities.\n   - The parameters `?item` and `?form` are abstract enough to apply to various ingredients or objects and their desired forms.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions include `(prepared ?item)` and `(at ?item workspace)`, generalizing the conditions needed before shaping or modifying an item.\n   - The effect `(shaped ?item ?form)` indicates the item has been shaped into the desired form, and `(not (prepared ?item))` reflects that the item is no longer in its initial prepared state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - The merged action avoids unnecessary complexity by using general terms and removing redundant specifics like `cooked`, `peeled`, or `kitchen_counter`.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent and reasonable for a variety of tasks involving shaping or modifying items.\n\nThis merged action can be adapted to different contexts and tasks involving shaping or modifying ingredients or objects, ensuring efficiency and simplicity.",
    "Sure, let's merge the given actions into a single universal action named `deep`, following the guidelines provided:\n\n### Merged Action Definition\n\n```lisp\n(:action deep ; Perform a deep transformation on a dish with various states\n    :parameters (?entity - dish ?tool - utensil ?location - place ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and\n        (has_state ?entity ?state)\n        (at ?tool ?location)\n        (available ?tool)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (transformed ?entity ?state)\n        (dirty ?tool)\n        (not (has_state ?entity ?state))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action `deep` is designed to be adaptable to various tasks by using abstract parameters like `?entity`, `?tool`, `?location`, and `?state`. This allows it to be applied to different contexts beyond just deep-frying rolls.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the change in state. The entity's state is transformed, and the tool used becomes dirty, reflecting a realistic scenario in various tasks.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects into a single action. The use of abstract parameters ensures the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring the preconditions and effects are reasonable in different contexts, such as requiring the tool to be available and at a specific location, and updating the entity's state appropriately.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `deep` can be effectively used for a variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating states, ensuring simplicity and efficiency in task execution."

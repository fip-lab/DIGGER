    "Certainly! The goal is to merge the provided PDDL actions into a single, universal action named `place` that remains general, captures the state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency.

    "Here is the merged PDDL action for the \"remove\" objective, combining the given actions into a single, universal action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action remove\n    :parameters (?p - player ?entity - object ?location - location ?tool - tool)\n    :precondition (and \n        (at ?p ?location) \n        (at ?entity ?location) \n        (or (and (in_container ?entity) (at ?container on_table))\n            (and (inventory ?p ?tool) (roots_dug ?entity))\n            (and (staked ?entity) (time_elapsed ?entity 1_year))\n            (and (cut_above_bud ?entity) (new_leaves ?entity))\n            (and (in_container ?entity ?container))\n        )\n    )\n    :effect (and \n        (or (at ?entity in_hand)\n            (root_ball_removed ?entity)\n            (not (staked ?entity))\n            (fully_grafted ?entity ?bud)\n            (not (in_container ?entity))\n        )\n        (not (at ?entity ?location))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The action is designed to handle a variety of removal tasks by using abstract parameters (`?entity`, `?location`, `?tool`). This allows it to adapt to tasks such as removing a shrub, a root ball, a stake, or a container.\n- **State Change**: Preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state changes involved in the removal process. The action checks if the entity is in the container, if roots are dug, if the entity is staked, or if it is ready for grafting, and then updates the state accordingly.\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained without unnecessary complexity. The preconditions ensure the player and entity are in the correct location and the entity is in a state that allows for removal. The effects update the entity's state to reflect its removal.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: By merging similar effects into a single action, redundancy is minimized. The action covers multiple scenarios where an entity is removed from its current state or location.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency across different tasks. It ensures that the preconditions are met before the entity's state is changed and that the effects are reasonable and clear.\n\nThis merged action simplifies the process of removing various entities while maintaining flexibility and applicability to different contexts.",

For example, if the target object is dirt, the effect will indicate `dirt_around ?target`. If the target is a season, the effect will be `chosen_time ?p ?target`. If the target is an area, the effect will be `selected ?target`. If the target is a planting tool, the effect will be `inventory ?p ?target`.\n   \n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action avoids redundancy by combining similar effects and removing unnecessary complexity. For example, the effect `(not (at ?dirt nearby))` is merged into the overall effect to ensure simplicity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - Each action maintains consistent logic across different tasks. Preconditions and effects are clearly defined to ensure the action `choose` can be applied reasonably in different contexts.\n\nBy merging the actions in this manner, the resulting action `choose` is adaptable to various scenarios and maintains clear and concise logic for state transformation.",
    "To create a merged action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, we need to abstract the parameters and ensure that the preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change while avoiding redundancy and maintaining logical consistency. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action check\n    :parameters (?actor - agent ?entity - object ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and (available ?actor) (not (checked ?actor ?entity)) (contextual_precondition ?context ?entity))\n    :effect (and (checked ?actor ?entity) (contextual_effect ?context ?entity))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: \n   - The parameters are abstracted to `?actor`, `?entity`, and `?context` to cover a wide range of possible tasks.\n   - `?actor` can be any agent (e.g., player, person), `?entity` can be any object (e.g., soil, pot, root ball), and `?context` is used to specify the particular situation or location relevant to the task.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions and effects are designed to facilitate the transformation of the entity's state.\n   - `available ?actor` ensures the actor is ready to perform the action.\n   - `not (checked ?actor ?entity)` ensures the entity has not been checked before.\n   - `contextual_precondition ?context ?entity` allows for specific preconditions relevant to the context.\n   - `checked ?actor ?entity` updates the state to reflect that the entity has been checked.\n   - `contextual_effect ?context ?entity` allows for specific effects relevant to the context.\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency**:\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining similar actions and abstracting the parameters.\n   - The action is kept simple by focusing on the core logic of checking and updating the entity's state.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The merged action maintains consistent logic by ensuring that preconditions and effects are clear and adaptable to different tasks.\n\n### Context-Specific Preconditions and Effects:\nTo handle context-specific logic, we can define additional predicates for `contextual_precondition` and `contextual_effect`. For example:\n\n- For checking soil:\n  ```pddl\n  (:predicate contextual_precondition_soil_test (?context - context ?entity - soil))\n  (:predicate contextual_effect_soil_test (?context - context ?entity - soil))\n  ```\n\n- For checking pots:\n  ```pddl\n  (:predicate contextual_precondition_pot_check (?context - context ?entity - pot))\n  (:predicate contextual_effect_pot_check (?context - context ?entity - pot))\n  ```\n\nThese predicates can be used within the preconditions and effects of the merged action to ensure the action adapts to specific tasks while maintaining logical consistency.",

It captures the changes in state and merges similar effects into a single, unified action. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it meets the guidelines:\n\n1. **Generality**: The action uses abstract parameters like `?p - player` and `?item - object` to ensure it can be applied to different tasks.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the state changes, transforming the entity's state progressively.\n3. **Simplicity**: By merging similar actions, the action avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts, ensuring the action is reasonable and clear.\n\n### Explanation of Preconditions and Effects:\n\n- The precondition `(available ?p)` ensures the player is ready to perform the action.\n- The `or` clause in preconditions allows the action to be applicable in multiple scenarios:\n  - `(at ?p ?item) (not (loosened ?item))`: For loosening roots or other objects.\n  - `(extracted ?item) (not (loosened ?item))`: For loosening a root ball after extraction.\n  - `(knows_transplant_date ?p ?item) (not (hardened ?item))`: For hardening a plant before transplant.\n  - `(in_pot ?item ?p) (not (fertilized ?p ?item))`: For fertilizing a pot with bone meal.\n\n- The `or` clause in effects ensures the appropriate state change is applied:\n  - `(loosened ?item)`: For general loosening.\n  - `(hardened ?item)`: For hardening a plant.\n  - `(fertilized ?p ?item)`: For fertilizing with bone meal.",

Preconditions require the player to be at a certain location and have the necessary items. The effect combines two items at the location and ensures they are no longer separate.\n\n3. **Simplicity:** The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar actions into one. It is simple and efficient, removing unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, with clear and reasonable preconditions and effects. It can be applied to a variety of contexts where combining or adding items is required.\n\nThis universal action `add` can now be used to handle multiple tasks involving adding, mixing, or tying items to change the state of an area or object in a game or simulation.",

The action checks if the actor has the substance in their inventory and if the substance has not already been applied to the target. The effect describes that the substance is applied to the target, and the substance is no longer available.\n- **Simplicity**: By consolidating common elements (such as having the substance in inventory and ensuring it has not been applied yet), we avoid redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency by ensuring reasonable preconditions (availability of actor and substance, and the substance not already being applied) and effects (substance gets applied and becomes unavailable).\n\n### Example Application:\n1. **apply_nair**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?p - player ?nair - item ?area - body_part)\n        :precondition (and (wet ?area) \n                           (inventory ?p ?nair) \n                           (not (applied ?nair ?area)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?nair ?area)\n                     (waiting_for_effect ?nair ?area)\n                     (not (available ?nair)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n2. **apply_depilatory_cream**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?actor - agent ?cream - product ?area - body_area)\n        :precondition (and (has_hair ?area)\n                           (inventory ?actor ?cream)\n                           (safe_for_use ?cream)\n                           (not (applied ?cream ?area)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?cream ?area)\n                     (not (has_hair ?area))\n                     (smooth_skin ?area)\n                     (not (available ?cream)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n3. **apply_powder_to_roots**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?a - agent ?p - powder ?h - hair)\n        :precondition (and (selected ?p) \n                           (inventory ?a ?p)\n                           (not (applied ?p ?h)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?p ?h)\n                     (powder_applied ?h)\n                     (not (available ?p)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n4. **apply_honey_and_remove_hair**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?actor - agent ?h - honey ?s - skin ?ha - hair)\n        :precondition (and (heated ?h)\n                           (clean ?s)\n                           (dry ?s)\n                           (long ?ha)\n                           (attached ?ha ?s)\n                           (inventory ?actor ?h)\n                           (not (applied ?h ?ha)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?h ?ha)\n                     (removed ?ha ?s)\n                     (not (attached ?ha ?s))\n                     (not (long ?ha))\n                     (not (available ?h)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n5. **apply_ganda_beroza**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?p - player ?ganda_beroza - ganda_beroza ?hair - body_hair)\n        :precondition (and (ready_to_apply ?ganda_beroza)\n                           (attached ?hair)\n                           (inventory ?p ?ganda_beroza)\n                           (not (applied ?ganda_beroza ?hair)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?ganda_beroza ?hair)\n                     (coated ?hair ?ganda_beroza)\n                     (not (ready_to_apply ?ganda_beroza))\n                     (not (available ?ganda_beroza)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n6. **apply_lotion**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?p - person ?l - lotion)\n        :precondition (and (shaved ?p)\n                           (inventory ?p ?l)\n                           (not (moisturized ?p))\n                           (not (applied ?l ?p)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?l ?p)\n                     (moisturized ?p)\n                     (not (available ?l)))\n    )\n    ```\n\n7. **apply_ice_wrap**:\n    ```lisp\n    (:action apply\n        :parameters (?actor - agent ?ice_wrap - tool ?hair - object)\n        :precondition (and (gum_in_hair ?hair)\n                           (inventory ?actor ?ice_wrap)\n                           (not (applied ?ice_wrap ?hair)))\n        :effect (and (applied ?ice_wrap ?hair)\n                     (gum_hardened ?hair)\n                     (not (gum_soft ?hair))\n                     (not (available ?ice_wrap)))\n    )\n    ```\n\nBy using this universal action template, the various individual application actions are merged into a single, adaptable action.",

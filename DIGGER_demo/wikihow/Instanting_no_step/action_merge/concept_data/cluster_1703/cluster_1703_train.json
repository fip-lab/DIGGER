    "Here is the merged action satisfying the guidelines provided:\n\n```pddl\n(:action allow ; Allow a process or state change to occur\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?condition - state)\n  :precondition (and (in_state ?entity ?condition) (not (blocked ?entity)))\n  :effect (state_changed ?entity ?condition)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"allow\" uses abstract parameters `?entity` and `?condition` to be applicable to a variety of tasks. This avoids limiting the action to specific types of actions like drying nail polish.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the change in state. The precondition checks if the entity is in the required state and if it is not blocked. The effect denotes that the state has changed.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: The action maintains simplicity by using generic parameters and avoiding any unnecessary complexity. It avoids redundancy by merging similar effects into a single unified effect.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistency across different tasks by clearly defining preconditions and effects that are logical and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action can now be adapted to various contexts where an entity is allowed to undergo a state change, ensuring it is available and not blocked, and then marking that the state has changed.",
    "Here is the merged PDDL action for the given actions:\n\n```pddl\n(:action apply ; Apply a substance or tool to a target object and update state\n    :parameters (?p - person ?substance - object ?target - object)\n    :precondition (and\n        (has_tool ?p ?substance)\n        (clean ?target)\n        (not (applied ?substance ?target))\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (applied ?substance ?target)\n        (if (or (is_glue ?substance) (is_gel ?substance)) (not (clean ?target)))\n        (if (is_whitening_pencil ?substance) (whitened_tips ?target))\n        (if (is_base_coat ?substance) (base_coat_applied ?target))\n        (if (is_polish ?substance) (coated ?target))\n        (if (is_topcoat ?substance) (top_coated ?target))\n        (if (is_gel_foundation ?substance) (gel_applied ?target))\n        (if (is_regular_polish ?substance) (polished ?target ?substance))\n        (if (is_tacky ?substance) (tacky ?target))\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n   - The action uses abstract parameters `?p`, `?substance`, and `?target` to cover various tasks involving applying different substances/tools to a target object.\n   - The merged action can be adapted to different tasks by changing the type of `?substance` and `?target`.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n   - Preconditions ensure the person has the tool/substance and the target is clean.\n   - The effect updates the state to reflect the substance/tool being applied and any additional changes such as making the target not clean if glue or gel is applied.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n   - Redundant actions are merged into a single action to avoid complexity.\n   - Only necessary state changes are included based on the type of substance/tool.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n   - The preconditions and effects are consistent with the logic of each individual action.\n   - Conditional effects reflect specific changes based on the type of substance/tool being applied.\n\nThis merged action should effectively cover the tasks mentioned in the given action sets, maintaining the core logic and ensuring simplicity and efficiency.",
    "Given the actions `let_glue_dry` and `let_nails_dry`, we can merge them into a single universal action `let` that encompasses waiting for a specific transformation, in this case, drying, to take place on an entity. Here's how we can combine them:\n\n```pddl\n(:action let ; Universal action to wait for a transformation to complete\n  :parameters (?entity - object ?transformation - transformation)\n  :precondition (and (applied ?transformation ?entity))\n  :effect (completed ?transformation ?entity)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The parameters `?entity` and `?transformation` are abstract, making the action adaptable to various tasks. Here `?entity` can be any object, and `?transformation` can be any transformation like drying, curing, setting, etc.\n- **State Change**: The action describes a state change where the transformation applied to the entity is completed.\n- **Simplicity**: Redundancies are avoided by merging similar actions (waiting for glue to dry and waiting for nails to dry) into one universal action.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The logic remains consistent by ensuring that any transformation must be applied before it can be completed.\n\n### Usage Examples:\n1. **Letting Glue Dry**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action let\n     :parameters (?nails - body-part ?transformation - glue_dry)\n     :precondition (and (glue_applied ?nails))\n     :effect (glue_dry ?nails)\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Letting Nails Dry**:\n   ```pddl\n   (:action let\n     :parameters (?nails - body-part ?transformation - nails_dry)\n     :precondition (and (nails_painted ?nails))\n     :effect (nails_dry ?nails)\n   )\n   ```\n\nThis merged action `let` can now be applied to a variety of transformations beyond just drying, ensuring a flexible and efficient representation of waiting for a state change in PDDL.",
    "To merge the provided actions into a single, universal PDDL action named `decide`, we need to incorporate the core logic, state changes, and maintain consistency while avoiding redundancy. Here's how the merged action can be defined:\n\n### Merged Action: `decide`\n\n```lisp\n(:action decide ; Decide on the use of an item and update its status\n  :parameters (?entity - object)\n  :precondition (and \n    (disorganized ?entity)\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (organized ?entity)\n    (selected_for_use ?entity)\n    (not (disorganized ?entity))\n  )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters are kept abstract (`?entity - object`) to generalize the action for various tasks, not limited to specific items.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly describe the transformation of the entity's state from `disorganized` to `organized` and `selected_for_use`.\n- **Core Logic**: The preconditions and effects are retained without unnecessary complexity, ensuring the essential logic of determining the state change and selection for use.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: Similar effects from different actions are merged into a single set of effects, avoiding redundancy.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency in its preconditions and effects, ensuring that the intended state changes are clear and reasonable for various contexts.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the action `decide` becomes a versatile and reusable component adaptable to a variety of tasks involving the organization and selection of items.",

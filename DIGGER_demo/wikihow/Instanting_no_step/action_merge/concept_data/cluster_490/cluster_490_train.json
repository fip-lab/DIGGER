Here is the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action sun ; Utilize sunlight for various tasks involving state transformation\n  :parameters (?agent - person ?item - object ?location - location ?condition - condition)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?location) (has ?agent ?item) (satisfies ?location ?condition))\n  :effect (and (transformed ?item ?condition) (not (original_state ?item)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The action uses abstract parameters like `?agent`, `?item`, `?location`, and `?condition` to increase applicability across different tasks.\n   - The `?condition` parameter is used to represent various conditions (e.g., sunny weather for bleaching linen).\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the agent is at the specified location, possesses the item, and the location satisfies the required condition (e.g., sunny weather).\n   - The effect indicates that the item is transformed based on the condition and its original state is no longer valid.\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The merged action removes redundancy by abstracting the conditions and effects into a single generalized form.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The logical structure of the preconditions and effects is consistent and reasonable across different tasks.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the merged action `sun` is adaptable to various tasks, capturing and transforming the entity's state in a clear and efficient manner.",
    "To properly merge the given PDDL actions into a single, universal action that can be adaptable to various tasks, we'll focus on the guidelines outlined. The resulting action should be general, clearly show state changes, be simple and efficient, and maintain logical consistency.\n\nGiven the example actions and the initial merged action example, here's how we can proceed with the provided actions:\n\n### Action name after merge: precondition\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n\n1. **precondition-hair**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action precondition-hair\n        :parameters (?hair - entity ?conditioner - entity)\n        :precondition (and (not (conditioned ?hair)) (available ?conditioner))\n        :effect (and (conditioned ?hair) (used ?conditioner))\n    )\n    ```\n\n2. **Juicing lemons**\n    ```lisp\n    (:action juice_lemons\n        :parameters (?lemons - entity ?juicer - entity)\n        :precondition (and (not (juiced ?lemons)) (available ?juicer))\n        :effect (and (juiced ?lemons) (used ?juicer))\n    )\n    ```\n\nBy merging these actions, we create a more generalized action that maintains the core logic of checking preconditions and applying effects while ensuring simplicity and logical consistency.\n\n### Merged Action: precondition\n```lisp\n(:action precondition\n    :parameters (?item - entity ?tool - entity)\n    :precondition (and (not (processed ?item)) (available ?tool))\n    :effect (and (processed ?item) (used ?tool))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The merged action uses abstract parameters (`?item` and `?tool`) to adapt to various tasks involving different entities.\n    - This action can be applied to any task where an item needs to be processed using a tool.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The preconditions ensure that `?item` is not yet processed and `?tool` is available.\n    - The effects describe that the `?item` becomes processed, and the `?tool` gets used.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - The action is concise, with no redundant conditions or effects.\n    - It merges the relevant parts of the original actions without unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic across different tasks.\n    - The structure is clear and reasonable for various contexts, such as conditioning hair or juicing lemons.\n\nThis merged action provides a flexible framework that can be applied to numerous scenarios that involve processing an item with a tool.",
    "(:action juice ; Juice an entity and update its state\n    :parameters (?entity - entity ?container - entity)\n    :precondition (and (not (juiced ?entity)) (empty ?container))\n    :effect (and (juiced ?entity) (filled-with-juice ?container))\n)",

The parameters are abstract, allowing the action to be adaptable to various tasks involving machines and entities.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the entity is prepared (e.g., a garment has been lightened) and the machine is operational. The effect reflects the entity being processed (e.g., cleaned, modified) and its \"prepared\" status being removed.\n- **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained, ensuring that the action is applicable to different contexts while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Avoid Redundancy**: By merging similar effects (e.g., cleaning a garment, processing an entity), redundancy is minimized, and the action remains simple.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains clear and reasonable preconditions and effects, ensuring logical consistency across different tasks.\n\nThis universal action captures the essence of the provided actions, focusing on a machine-related task that involves processing an entity and updating its state accordingly.",
    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"determine\" that maintains generality, clearly describes state changes, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and remains logically consistent, we follow these guidelines.

The action checks if the `?agent` and `?resource` are available and whether the task (`?task`) has been done for the resource. If not, the action updates the status to indicate the task is done.\n3. **Simplicity**: The merged action avoids redundancy by combining similar preconditions and effects into a single action without unnecessary complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks, ensuring that the preconditions and effects are clear and reasonable.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of both given actions while remaining adaptable to a variety of tasks."

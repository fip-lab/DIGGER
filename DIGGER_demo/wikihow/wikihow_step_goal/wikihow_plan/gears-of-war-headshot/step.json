        "Sniper \u2014 Simply aim at the head and pull the trigger, unless you're the host, in which case you will need to aim in front of where they're going.",
        "Shotgun \u2014 The aim on the shotgun is almost like a rectangle.",
        "Pistol \u2014 I'm not sure because I haven't played in a while, but it's either six or seven shots to the head with the standard-issue pistol for a headshot.",
        "BoomShot \u2014 BoomShot headshots are possible \u2014 don't let anyone tell you they're not but the chance of one happening is about a million to one."

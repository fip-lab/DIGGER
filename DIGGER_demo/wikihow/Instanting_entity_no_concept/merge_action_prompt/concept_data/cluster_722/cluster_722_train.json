The precondition checks that the `npc` is not already at the emergency room, and the effect sets the `npc`'s location to the emergency room.\n2. **get_physical_examination**: This action involves `you` getting a physical examination from a `doctor`. The precondition ensures that `you` are at the emergency room and a `doctor` is available. The effect sets `you` as examined and marks the `doctor` as busy.\n3. **test_cyst**: This action involves testing `you` for a ruptured cyst. The precondition checks that `you` have been examined and that a diagnostic test is available. The effect marks `you` as tested for a cyst and the test as conducted.\n\nThese actions capture the intent, logic, and state changes associated with treating a ruptured ovarian cyst.

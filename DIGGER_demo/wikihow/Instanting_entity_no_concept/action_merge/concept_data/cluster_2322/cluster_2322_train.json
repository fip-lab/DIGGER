    "Below is the merged universal action called \"make\". This action captures the essence of creating or modifying various states, such as braiding hair, creating loops, and weaving strings, while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity.\n\n```pddl\n(:action make\n    :parameters (?entity - object ?state1 - state ?state2 - state ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and \n                    (current_shape ?entity ?state1)\n                    (applicable_context ?entity ?context)\n                  )\n    :effect (and \n              (current_shape ?entity ?state2)\n              (updated_context ?entity ?context)\n            )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?entity`, `?state1`, `?state2`, and `?context` are abstract and can be adapted to a variety of tasks. This makes the action applicable for creating or modifying different entities (like hair, loops, strings) in different contexts.\n2. **State Change**: The precondition `(current_shape ?entity ?state1)` ensures that the entity is in the initial state before the action is applied. The effect `(current_shape ?entity ?state2)` captures the new state after the action is applied, reflecting the change in state.\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects is retained, ensuring that the action is logically consistent and straightforward.\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Similar effects (e.g., changing the shape of hair or creating loops) are merged into a single effect clause, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n5. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects are kept reasonable and clear, ensuring that the action can be consistently applied across different tasks and contexts.\n\n### Detailed Mapping to Original Actions:\n- **Hair Braiding**:\n  - `make_side_braid`, `make_topsy_turvy`, `make_sliplargerbeads`, `make_braided_braid`, and `create_braided_headband` are mapped to changing the shape of the hair (`?entity`) from one state (`?state1`) to another (`?state2`) within the context of hair styling (`?context`).\n\n- **Loop Creation**:\n  - `make_loop`, `create_loop`, and `turn_into_new_loop` are mapped to creating or modifying loops (`?entity` in the loop context) from one state (`?state1`) to another (`?state2`).\n\n- **String Weaving**:\n  - `weave_string` and `weave_remaining_string` are mapped to weaving strings (`?entity` as strings) from a grouped state (`?state1`) to a weaved state (`?state2`) within the context of string weaving (`?context`).\n\nThis merged action allows for a flexible and scalable approach to a variety of tasks involving checking, modifying, or creating, ensuring adaptability and efficiency.",
    "Based on the given guidelines and the provided actions, the merged action 'hang' should be adaptable, clearly describe the state change, retain core logic, avoid redundancy, and maintain logical consistency.

After the action, the support is in use, and the entity is hung.\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundant or unnecessary complexities are removed, ensuring the action remains straightforward.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The merged action maintains consistent logic across different contexts by ensuring clear and reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nThis merged action captures the essence of the original actions while maintaining flexibility and simplicity.",

This generalizes the action to be applicable to various hair-related tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The preconditions ensure that the hair is in a specific initial state (`fishtail_braid` or `normal`), and the effects transform the hair to a new state (`bun` or `swept_to_side`).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action is simplified by using logical OR in the preconditions and effects to cover both original actions. This avoids redundancy and unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are logically consistent, ensuring that the action's transformation makes sense in different contexts.

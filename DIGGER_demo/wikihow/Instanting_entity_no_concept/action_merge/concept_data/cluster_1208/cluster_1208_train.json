This allows the action to be used for different types of entities and conditions.\n  \n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects describe the state change clearly. The entity moves from one location to another, and any relevant status is updated.\n  \n- **Simplicity**: Redundancy is avoided by merging the core logic into a single action. Unnecessary complexity is removed by using abstract parameters and conditions.\n  \n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain consistent logic, ensuring that the action can be applied in different contexts while keeping the preconditions and effects reasonable. The additional parameter `?condition` allows for conditional checks relevant to the specific task, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.\n\nThis merged action can be used to represent various tasks involving movement, checking conditions, and updating statuses, thereby meeting the objectives and guidelines provided.",
    "To create a merged action named `default` that adheres to the guidelines and combines the provided actions into a single, abstract, and adaptable action, we need to generalize the parameters and logically combine the preconditions and effects. Below is the resulting PDDL action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action default ; Generalized action for various tasks\n  :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity1 - object ?entity2 - object)\n  :precondition (and (at ?agent ?entity1) (at ?entity1 ?entity2) (not (processed ?entity1)))\n  :effect (processed ?entity1)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The parameters are generalized to `?agent`, `?entity1`, and `?entity2`, which can represent a variety of agents and objects in different contexts (e.g., a player, a book, a goat cheese, etc.).\n\n2. **State Change**: The precondition and effect clearly show the state change by using the predicates `at` and `processed`.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of checking and updating states is retained with simplified preconditions and effects.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Redundant elements are removed, and similar effects are merged into a single, efficient action.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains reasonable and clear preconditions and effects across different tasks, making it adaptable for various scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the merged action `default` encompasses the logic of checking, modifying, or creating tasks by an agent, ensuring simplicity and efficiency."

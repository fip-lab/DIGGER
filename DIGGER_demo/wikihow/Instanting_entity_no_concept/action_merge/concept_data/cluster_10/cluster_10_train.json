    "Based on the provided guidelines and examples, here is the merged action for the \"visit\" tasks:\n\n```pddl\n(:action visit ; Visit a resource to gain information or update status\n  :parameters (?npc - person ?resource - object)\n  :precondition (and (visible ?npc) (not (visited ?npc ?resource)))\n  :effect (and (visited ?npc ?resource) (has_knowledge ?npc ?resource))\n)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Generality**: The action is named \"visit\" and it uses abstract parameters (`?npc - person`, `?resource - object`) to make it adaptable to multiple contexts where a visit action is required.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that the `?npc` is visible and has not yet visited the `?resource`. The effects update the state by marking the `?npc` as having visited the `?resource` and gaining knowledge from it.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is concise, combining the logic of visiting and acquiring knowledge without redundant complexity.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain a clear and reasonable logic that can be applied to different tasks involving visits and knowledge acquisition.\n\nThis merged action can now be used in various scenarios where an entity (person) needs to visit a resource (such as a website, location, or any other object) and gain information or update the status.",

    "To merge the given actions into a single universal action named \"market,\" we need to ensure that the merged action is general, captures the state change, keeps the logic simple, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here are the specific details for merging the actions provided:\n\n### Given Actions to Merge:\n1. **market_new_member_group**\n    ```pddl\n    (:action market_new_member_group\n        :parameters (?npc - npc ?adrian - adrian ?ss - ss)\n        :precondition (and (knowledge ?adrian unselected))\n        :effect (and (knowledge ?adrian selected))\n    )\n    ```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action market\n    :parameters (?agent - agent ?entity - entity ?context - context)\n    :precondition (and (knowledge ?entity unselected))\n    :effect (and (knowledge ?entity selected))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**:\n    - The action name \"market\" is chosen for its broad applicability.\n    - The parameters are generalized to `?agent`, `?entity`, and `?context` to apply to diverse tasks.\n\n2. **State Change**:\n    - The precondition checks if the `?entity` (in this case, `?adrian`) has `knowledge` in the `unselected` state.\n    - The effect changes the `knowledge` status of the `?entity` to `selected`.\n\n3. **Simplicity**:\n    - The merged action avoids redundancy by directly capturing the essence of the state change from `unselected` to `selected` for any entity.\n    - Irrelevant details specific to the original action are abstracted away.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**:\n    - The precondition and effect logic remains clear and reasonable. The action checks the current state and updates it accordingly.\n\nThus, the merged action \"market\" is designed to be general, simple, and applicable to a variety of similar tasks involving state changes of knowledge from `unselected` to `selected`."

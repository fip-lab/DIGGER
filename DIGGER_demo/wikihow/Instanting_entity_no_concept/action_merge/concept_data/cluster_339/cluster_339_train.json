The action can apply to sticking to a process, checking an item, or updating task status.\n- **State Change**: The action clearly describes the state change through preconditions and effects, reflecting the transition from available to completed, and specific state changes like `sticking_to_dry_cycles` and `in_dryer`.\n- **Simplicity**: The action avoids redundancy by merging similar conditions and effects, ensuring that the merged action is straightforward and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts, ensuring reasonable and clear transitions.\n\nThis merged action encapsulates the essence of the provided examples, unifying the checking and sticking tasks into a versatile and adaptable action.",
    "To create a merged action named \"dry\" by combining the provided actions, we'll follow the guidelines to ensure generality, clear state change, simplicity, and logical consistency. Here is the merged action:\n\n### Merged Action: dry\n\n#### Action Sets to Merge:\n1. **Dry Clothes**\n```pddl\n(:action dry_clothes\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?clothes - clothes ?work_station - work_station)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?work_station) (has_clothes ?npc ?clothes))\n    :effect (and (dry ?clothes) (not (wet ?clothes)))\n)\n```\n\n2. **Add Dryer Sheets**\n```pddl\n(:action add_dryer_sheets\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?dryer_sheet - item ?work_station - work_station)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?work_station) (has_dryer_sheet ?npc ?dryer_sheet) (not (added_dryer_sheet ?work_station)))\n    :effect (added_dryer_sheet ?work_station)\n)\n```\n\n#### Merged Action\n```pddl\n(:action dry\n    :parameters (?npc - person ?item - object ?work_station - work_station)\n    :precondition (and (at ?npc ?work_station) \n                       (or (and (has_clothes ?npc ?item) (not (dry ?item))) \n                           (and (has_dryer_sheet ?npc ?item) (not (added_dryer_sheet ?work_station)))))\n    :effect (and (or (and (dry ?item) (not (wet ?item))) \n                     (added_dryer_sheet ?work_station)))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"dry\" can now handle both drying clothes and adding dryer sheets, making it adaptable to tasks involving both objects.\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects reflect the state changes clearly. For drying clothes, it changes the state from `wet` to `dry`. For adding dryer sheets, it changes the state to `added_dryer_sheet`.\n3. **Simplicity**: The action is concise and avoids redundancy by combining similar state changes and conditions.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: Preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency. The action checks if the NPC has the item (clothes or dryer sheet) and is at the work station before performing the respective operations.\n\nThis merged action effectively integrates the logic of drying clothes and adding dryer sheets into a single, versatile \"dry\" action that can be applied to various tasks involving these activities.",

    "Based on the guidelines and the given examples, the merged action for \"encourage\" needs to capture the essence of encouraging actions across different contexts. Here is an example of how the \"encourage\" action can be merged to meet the objective:\n\n### Merged Action: encourage\n\n```pddl\n(:action encourage ; Encourage an entity and update its state\n  :parameters (?npc - entity ?state_after - state)\n  :precondition (and (visible ?npc) (not (state ?npc ?state_after)))\n  :effect (and (not (visible ?npc)) (state ?npc ?state_after))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality:**\n   - The `?npc` parameter is abstract and can refer to any entity, making the action applicable to a variety of tasks.\n   - The `?state_after` parameter represents the state that the entity will transition to after being encouraged, allowing for different end states.\n\n2. **State Change:**\n   - The precondition ensures the entity is initially visible (`visible ?npc`) and not already in the state to be achieved (`not (state ?npc ?state_after)`).\n   - The effect hides the entity (`not (visible ?npc)`) and sets its state to the desired state (`state ?npc ?state_after`).\n\n3. **Simplicity:**\n   - The action is concise, using abstract parameters to cover multiple scenarios.\n   - Redundancy is avoided by combining visibility changes and state transitions into a single action.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:**\n   - The preconditions and effects are reasonable and maintain logical consistency across different contexts.\n   - The action clearly defines the transition from a visible state to an invisible state while updating the entity's state.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged \"encourage\" action can effectively encompass various scenarios where encouraging an entity results in a change of state.",

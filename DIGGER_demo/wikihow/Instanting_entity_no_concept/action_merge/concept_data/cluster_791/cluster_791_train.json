It focuses on the core logic of locating an item and updating its status.\n\n**Logical Consistency:**\n- The precondition and effect maintain consistent logic, ensuring that the action is applicable in different contexts and clearly reflects the state change from not located to located.\n\nThis merged `locate` action should be adaptable to various tasks involving the location of different items by different agents, maintaining simplicity and efficiency.",
    "In order to merge the given actions into a single universal action that is adaptable to a variety of tasks, we need to ensure that the action is general enough to apply to different contexts while maintaining logical consistency and simplicity.

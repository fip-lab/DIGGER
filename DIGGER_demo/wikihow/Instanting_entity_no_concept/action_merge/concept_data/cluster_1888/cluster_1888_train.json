This makes it adaptable to chopping different ingredients and placing them in various containers.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in the state of the ingredient and the container, ensuring that the ingredient becomes chopped and, if applicable, placed into the container.\n\n3. **Core Logic**: The core logic of preconditions and effects from both actions (`chop-tomatoes` and `cut_bread`) is retained. The precondition `whole ?item` indicates that the ingredient must be whole before chopping, and the effect `chopped ?item` indicates the ingredient is chopped afterward.\n\n4. **Avoid Redundancy**: Redundancy is eliminated by combining similar effects. For example, both actions involve changing the state of the ingredient to indicate it has been chopped or cut.\n\n5. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains logical consistency across different contexts. The conditional effect `(when (empty ?container) (and (inContainer ?item ?container) (full ?container)))` ensures that placing chopped items in the container only occurs when the container is initially empty, maintaining reasonable preconditions and effects.\n\nBy merging the actions this way, we create a single, versatile `chop` action that applies to multiple scenarios involving chopping and updating the state of ingredients and containers.",

This mirrors the state changes in the original actions, where items were shaped or cut.\n\n**Simplicity:** By merging actions with similar effects (transforming an ingredient), redundancy is avoided, and the merged action remains simple and efficient.\n\n**Logical Consistency:** The merged action maintains the core logic of the original actions, with reasonable preconditions (the item must be at the kitchen counter) and effects (the item is transformed).\n\nThis merged action `shape` can now be utilized in multiple contexts where an ingredient needs to be transformed, whether by shaping, cutting, or other means, thus achieving the goal state progressively and effectively.",
    "To merge the actions \"be_amazed\" and \"heat_peanut_oil\" into a single universal action, we need to ensure that the new action is general, captures state changes effectively, retains core logic, avoids redundancy, and maintains logical consistency. Here's how this can be done:\n\n### Given Actions:\n\n#### Action: be_amazed\n```lisp\n(:action be_amazed\n    :parameters (?npc - npc)\n    :precondition (and (cooked ?eggroll) (not (amazed ?npc)))\n    :effect (amazed ?npc)\n)\n```\n\n#### Action: heat_peanut_oil\n```lisp\n(:action heat_peanut_oil\n    :parameters (?chef - person ?oil - ingredient)\n    :precondition (and (available ?chef) (not (heated ?oil)))\n    :effect (heated ?oil)\n)\n```\n\n### Merged Action:\n\n#### Action: be\n```lisp\n(:action be\n    :parameters (?actor - entity ?item - object ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and (available ?actor) (not (?state ?item)))\n    :effect (?state ?item)\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generality**: The merged action \"be\" uses abstract parameters such as `?actor`, `?item`, and `?state` to ensure it can adapt to a variety of tasks. This allows the action to be used in different contexts like making an NPC amazed or heating an ingredient.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the change in state. The precondition ensures that the action is only performed if the actor is available and the item is not already in the desired state. The effect updates the item's state.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: By combining the actions into one, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The logical structure of preconditions and effects is maintained consistently across different contexts.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n#### Be Amazed:\n```lisp\n(:action be\n    :parameters (?npc - npc ?eggroll - object ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and (cooked ?eggroll) (not (amazed ?npc)))\n    :effect (amazed ?npc)\n)\n```\n\n#### Heat Peanut Oil:\n```lisp\n(:action be\n    :parameters (?chef - person ?oil - ingredient ?state - state)\n    :precondition (and (available ?chef) (not (heated ?oil)))\n    :effect (heated ?oil)\n)\n```\n\nBy using the merged action \"be,\" we have created a universal action that can be adapted to different scenarios while maintaining clarity, simplicity, and consistency.",
    "Here is the merged action based on the provided actions and guidelines:\n\n### Action name after merge: deep\n\n### Action sets that need to be merged:\n1. **Deep Fry**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action deep_fry\n       :parameters (?item - ingredient ?pan - utensil ?oil - ingredient)\n       :precondition (and\n           (wrapped ?item ?oil)\n           (has_oil ?pan)\n           (at ?pan kitchen_stove)\n           (heated ?stove)\n       )\n       :effect (and\n           (fried ?item)\n           (dirty ?pan)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Serve Potatoes**\n   ```pddl\n   (:action serve_potatoes\n       :parameters (?potatoes - ingredient ?plate - utensil)\n       :precondition (and\n           (fried ?potatoes)\n           (clean ?plate)\n       )\n       :effect (and\n           (served ?potatoes ?plate)\n           (dirty ?plate)\n       )\n   )\n   ```\n\n### The actions after the merger are:\n```pddl\n(:action deep\n    :parameters (?item - ingredient ?utensil - utensil ?place - location)\n    :precondition (and\n        (wrapped ?item ?wrapper)\n        (has_oil ?utensil)\n        (at ?utensil ?place)\n        (heated ?place)\n        (clean ?utensil)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n        (fried ?item)\n        (dirty ?utensil)\n        (served ?item ?utensil)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Generality**: The merged action `deep` uses abstract parameters such as `?item` (ingredient), `?utensil` (utensil), and `?place` (location) to adapt to a variety of tasks involving deep frying and serving.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions ensure the item is wrapped, the utensil has oil, is at the correct place, and is heated. The effects reflect the state change of the item being fried, the utensil becoming dirty, and the item being served.\n- **Simplicity**: This action combines the preconditions and effects logically without redundancy, ensuring simplicity and efficiency.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are consistent and make sense in the context of deep frying and serving, maintaining a clear and reasonable logic.\n\nThis merged action should be adaptable to various tasks involving deep frying and serving processes."

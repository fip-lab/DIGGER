    "To merge the provided actions into a single universal action in PDDL that adheres to the guidelines of generality, state change, simplicity, and logical consistency, we need to identify the core logic and effects of each action, avoiding redundancy and maintaining a clear transformation of the entity's state.

This allows the action to be applicable in different contexts where a machine needs to be restarted with the help of an actor and an item.\n\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly reflect the state change. The machine transitions from being off to on, and the item used by the actor is marked as used in the machine.\n\n3. **Simplicity**: Redundancies are avoided by merging similar effects and ensuring the action remains straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The action maintains consistent logic across different tasks. Preconditions and effects are reasonable and ensure the action can be applied in various scenarios without losing coherence.\n\nBy following these principles, the merged action `restart` captures the core logic of the provided actions while ensuring it is adaptable, simple, and logically consistent across different contexts.",

    "### Universal Action: dig\n\nThis universal \"dig\" action consolidates the actions from the provided examples, encapsulating various digging and removal activities into a single, adaptable action.\n\n```lisp\n(:action dig ; A universal action for digging and modifying entity states\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - entity ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (at ?npc ?location)\n                  (or (not (dug ?item)) \n                      (and (inventory ?npc ?item) (at ?item ?location))\n                      (and (in_garden ?npc) (soil_removed ?item) (not (dug ?item))))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (dug ?item)\n            (or (not (at ?item ?location)) \n                (at ?item container))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Generality**: The parameters are abstract (e.g., `?npc`, `?item`, `?location`) to allow the action to be adaptable to various tasks like digging holes, areas, tinder, and root balls.\n- **State Change**: The preconditions and effects clearly define the state changes. For example, an item transitions from not being dug to being dug, and its location might change accordingly.\n- **Simplicity**: By merging similar actions and using abstract parameters, redundancy is avoided, and the action remains simple and efficient.\n- **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects are logically consistent across different contexts, ensuring clarity and reasonableness.\n\n### Additional Universal Actions:\n\n1. **remove**:\n\n```lisp\n(:action remove ; A universal action for removing entities and updating their states\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - entity ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (at ?npc ?location)\n                  (or (and (at ?item ?location) (inventory ?npc ?item))\n                      (and (in_garden ?item) (watered ?item)))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (not (at ?item ?location))\n            (or (in_container ?item) \n                (soil_removed ?item))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n2. **build**:\n\n```lisp\n(:action build ; A universal action for building structures and modifying states\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?structure - structure ?location - place)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (at ?npc ?location)\n                  (or (planted ?structure ?location)\n                      (not (created ?structure)))\n                )\n  :effect (and \n            (or (water_basin_built ?location)\n                (created ?structure))\n          )\n)\n```\n\n3. **prepare**:\n\n```lisp\n(:action prepare ; A universal action for preparing items and updating their states\n  :parameters (?npc - agent ?item - entity)\n  :precondition (and \n                  (raw ?item))\n  :effect (and \n            (prepared ?item))\n)\n```\n\nThese additional actions follow the same guidelines, ensuring they are general, reflect state changes, are simple, and maintain logical consistency across various tasks.",

This makes it adaptable to a variety of tasks.\n\n2. **State Change:** The preconditions and effects reflect the state changes clearly by checking if the NPC is available and not yet checked the item, while also considering the location context (such as whether a hole is dug or if the NPC is at a garden center).\n\n3. **Simplicity and Efficiency:** Redundancy is avoided by merging similar effects. For instance, both soil checking and testing are reduced to a single `checked` effect, while the specific conditions for soil and testing are merged into the preconditions.\n\n4. **Logical Consistency:** The merged action maintains consistent logic across different tasks by keeping reasonable preconditions and effects. The use of logical OR (`or`) ensures that the action can adapt to different contexts without unnecessary complexity.\n\nThis merged action should efficiently handle checking resources and updating task status across various scenarios, ensuring both simplicity and adaptability.",

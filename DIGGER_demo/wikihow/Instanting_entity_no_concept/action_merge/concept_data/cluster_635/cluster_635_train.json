Redundant actions are combined to ensure efficiency.\n4. **Logical Consistency**: The preconditions and effects maintain logical consistency across different contexts by ensuring reasonable state changes.\n\n### Justification:\nThe merged action \"add\" captures the essence of combining, mixing, and adding entities into containers while ensuring that the state changes are consistent and logical. This approach ensures that the action can be applied to various tasks like mixing ingredients, combining items, or adding components to a container, making it a versatile and efficient solution.",
    "### Merged Action: cook\n\n#### Explanation:\nThe merged action `cook` is designed to be a universal action adaptable to various cooking tasks. This action includes abstract parameters to cover multiple scenarios involving cooking processes, from preparing to steaming, checking doneness, and signaling an NPC. The preconditions and effects are generalized to reflect the state changes necessary in cooking tasks while maintaining logical consistency and avoiding redundancy.\n\n#### Merged Action Definition:\n```pddl\n(:action cook\n  :parameters (?agent - entity ?item - entity ?location - location ?tool - entity ?ingredient - entity)\n  :precondition (and\n    (at ?agent ?location)\n    (available ?item)\n    (clean ?location)\n    (off ?tool)\n    (not (prepared ?ingredient))\n    (not (cooked ?item))\n  )\n  :effect (and\n    (not (available ?item))\n    (messy ?location)\n    (on ?tool)\n    (prepared ?ingredient)\n    (cooked ?item)\n    (checked ?agent ?item)\n    (not (visible ?agent))\n    (invisible ?agent)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n#### Description of Key Components:\n1. **Parameters:**\n   - `?agent` - The entity performing the action (could be a person, NPC, or player).\n   - `?item` - The item being cooked (e.g., steak, chuck steak).\n   - `?location` - The location where the action takes place (e.g., kitchen).\n   - `?tool` - The tool being used (e.g., stove, blender).\n   - `?ingredient` - An ingredient involved in the cooking process (e.g., Velveeta, lemon).\n\n2. **Preconditions:**\n   - `at ?agent ?location` - The agent must be at the specified location.\n   - `available ?item` - The item must be available for cooking.\n   - `clean ?location` - The location must be clean.\n   - `off ?tool` - The tool must be turned off initially.\n   - `not (prepared ?ingredient)` - The ingredient must not already be prepared.\n   - `not (cooked ?item)` - The item must not already be cooked.\n\n3. **Effects:**\n   - `not (available ?item)` - The item is no longer available for other tasks.\n   - `messy ?location` - The location becomes messy after the action.\n   - `on ?tool` - The tool is turned on as part of the cooking process.\n   - `prepared ?ingredient` - The ingredient is prepared (e.g., placed on the counter).\n   - `cooked ?item` - The item becomes cooked.\n   - `checked ?agent ?item` - The agent checks the item (e.g., for doneness).\n   - `not (visible ?agent)` - The agent is no longer visible.\n   - `invisible ?agent` - The agent becomes invisible (could signify being busy or hidden during the cooking process).\n\nBy merging the actions into a single universal `cook` action, we achieve a high level of generality and applicability to various cooking-related tasks while maintaining logical consistency and avoiding redundancy. The preconditions and effects are clearly defined to reflect the necessary state changes, ensuring simplicity and efficiency in the execution of the action.",
    "Based on the guidelines provided, the merged action for serving a meal can be designed to be adaptable to different combinations of items to be served together. The preconditions and effects will reflect the transformation of the state of entities from being cooked and at specific locations to being served on a plate. Here's the merged action:\n\n```pddl\n(:action serve\n    ; Serve a meal with various items\n    :parameters (?item1 - entity ?item2 - entity ?plate - entity)\n    :precondition (and\n      (is_cooked ?item1)\n      (at_location ?item1 ?loc1)\n      (at_location ?item2 ?loc2)\n    )\n    :effect (and\n      (not (at_location ?item1 ?loc1))\n      (not (at_location ?item2 ?loc2))\n      (at_location ?item1 on_plate)\n      (at_location ?item2 on_plate)\n      (is_served ?item1)\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Generality**: The parameters `?item1` and `?item2` are abstract and can represent any entities (e.g., steak, vegetables, chimichurri).\n2. **State Change**: The preconditions ensure that `?item1` is cooked and both items are at specific locations.

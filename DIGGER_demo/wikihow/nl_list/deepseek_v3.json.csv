2. **Prepare the Workspace**: Choose a well-ventilated area and place a heat-resistant mat or surface to protect your workspace.

3. **Remove Wicks and Debris**: Take out any wicks, labels, or debris from the candles to ensure clean melting.

4. **Chop or Break Candles**: Cut or break the candles into smaller pieces to speed up the melting process.

9. **Stir Gently**: As the wax melts, stir it gently to combine any separated components (e.g., colors or scents).

10. **Prepare Molds or Containers**: While the wax is melting, prepare the molds or containers where you’ll pour the melted wax. Add new wicks if necessary.

11. **Pour the Melted Wax**: Once fully melted, carefully pour the wax into the prepared molds or containers. Allow it to cool and solidify completely.

12. **Clean Up**: Turn off the heat, let the double boiler cool, and clean your utensils and workspace. Dispose of any leftover wax or debris responsibly.
